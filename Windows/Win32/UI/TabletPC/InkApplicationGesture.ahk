/**
 * Defines values that set the interest in a set of application-specific gesture.Application gestures are gestures that you can choose to have your application support.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The default value is <b>NoGesture</b>, which is actually a cutoff line that represents the Microsoft gesture recognizer minimum suggested confidence. It does not actually represent a gesture or lack of gesture, just the point at which the gesture recognizer lacks enough confidence in the result accuracy to recommend anything following that point.
  * 
  * For example, assume that a gesture array consists of the following values: <b>Circle</b>, <b>LeftRight</b>, <b>NoGesture</b>, <b>RightLeft</b>, and <b>Triangle</b>. In this case, the gesture recognizer has a great degree of confidence in <b>Circle</b> and less confidence in <b>LeftRight</b>. The recognizer has very low confidence in <b>RightLeft</b> and <b>Triangle</b> because they come after <b>NoGesture</b> in the array order.
  * 
  * The confidence level at which the gesture recognizer returns <b>NoGesture</b> cannot be changed.
  * 
  * If <b>NoGesture</b> is the first element in the array (which means that every recognized gesture is below the suggested confidence threshold), then the platform alters the default value of the <i>Cancel</i> parameter in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/tablet/inkcollector-gesture">Gesture</a> event handler from <b>FALSE</b> to <b>TRUE</b>. This causes the ink to be considered a stroke and not be deleted from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/tablet/inkdisp-class">InkDisp</a> object by default.
