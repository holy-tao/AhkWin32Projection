/**
 * Specifies the interest in a set of operating system-specific gestures.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The flick gesture is recognized in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.
  * 
  * The Windows Vista and Tablet PC operating systems support these gestures by default. When any of these gestures are recognized, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/tablet/inkcollector-systemgesture">SystemGesture</a> event fires automatically. Many of these gestures map to traditional mouse events. For instance, the Tap system gesture mimics a click of the left mouse button.
  * 
  * A system gesture is separate from an application gesture. Application gestures are defined in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/ne-msinkaut-inkapplicationgesture">InkApplicationGesture</a> enumeration type.
  * 
  * For more information about system gestures, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/tablet/using-gestures">Using Gestures</a>.
