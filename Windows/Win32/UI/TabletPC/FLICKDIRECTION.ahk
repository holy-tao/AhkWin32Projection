/**
 * Defines the directions in which a pen flick has occurred.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * A pen flick is a unidirectional pen gesture that requires the user to contact the digitizer in a quick, straight flicking motion. A flick is characterized by high speed and a high degree of straightness. A flick is identified by its direction. Flicks can be made in eight directions corresponding to the cardinal and secondary compass directions.
