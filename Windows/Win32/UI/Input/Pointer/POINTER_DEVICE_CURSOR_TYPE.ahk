/**
 * Identifies the pointer device cursor types.

 * 
  * Cursor objects represent pointing and selecting devices used with digitizer devices, most commonly tactile contacts on touch digitizers and tablet pens on pen digitizers. Physical pens may have multiple tips (such as normal and eraser ends), with each pen tip representing a different cursor object. Each cursor object has an associated cursor identifier.
