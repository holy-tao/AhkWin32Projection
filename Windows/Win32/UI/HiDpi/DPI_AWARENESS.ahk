/**
 * Identifies the dots per inch (dpi) setting for a thread, process, or window.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * In previous versions of Windows, DPI values were only set once for an entire application. For those apps, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shellscalingapi/ne-shellscalingapi-process_dpi_awareness">PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS</a> type determined the type of DPI awareness for the entire application. Currently, the DPI awareness is defined on an individual thread, window, or process level and is indicated by the <b>DPI_AWARENESS</b> type. While the focus shifted from a process level to a thread level, the different kinds of DPI awareness are the same: unaware, system aware, and per monitor aware. For detailed descriptions and some examples of the different DPI kinds, see <b>PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS</b>.
  * 
  * The old recommendation was to define the DPI awareness level in the application manifest using the setting <i>dpiAware</i> as explained in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shellscalingapi/ne-shellscalingapi-process_dpi_awareness">PROCESS_DPI_AWARENESS</a>. Now that the DPI awareness is tied to threads and windows instead of an entire application, a new windows setting is added to the app manifest. This setting is <i>dpiAwareness</i> and will override any <i>dpiAware</i> setting if both of them are present in the manifest. While it is still recommended to use the manifest, you can now change the DPI awareness while the app is running by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setthreaddpiawarenesscontext">SetThreadDpiAwarenessContext</a>.
  * 
  * It is important to note that if your application has a <b>DPI_AWARENESS_PER_MONITOR_AWARE</b> window, you are responsible for keeping track of the DPI by responding to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/hidpi/wm-dpichanged">WM_DPICHANGED</a> messages.
