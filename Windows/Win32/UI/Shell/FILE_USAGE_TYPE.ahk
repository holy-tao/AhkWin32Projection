/**
 * Constants used by IFileIsInUse::GetUsage to indicate how a file in use is being used.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The interpretation of "playing" or "editing" is left to the application's implementation of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ifileisinuse">IFileIsInUse</a>. Generally, "playing" would refer to a media file while "editing" can refer to any file being altered in an application. However, the application itself best knows how to map these terms to its actions.
