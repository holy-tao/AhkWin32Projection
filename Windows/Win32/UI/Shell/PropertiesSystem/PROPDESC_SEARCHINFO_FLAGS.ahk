 * Determines whether and how a property is indexed by Windows Search.

 * 
  * For third parties, the PDSIF_ALWAYSINCLUDE flag can be referred to in user-specified query strings, even though its value may not be retrievable from the index in query results. The meaning of the PDSIF_ALWAYSINCLUDE flag to the indexer when a third party sets the flag through a custom schema definition is that it enables users to refer to this property in query strings even though its value is not stored in the index.
  * 
  * Property mnemonics refers to a shortened name for a property.
