/**
 * Contains information used by ShellExecuteEx. (Unicode)
 * @remarks
 * The <b>SEE_MASK_NOASYNC</b> flag must be specified if the thread calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecuteexa">ShellExecuteEx</a> does not have a message loop or if the thread or process will terminate soon after <b>ShellExecuteEx</b> returns. Under such conditions, the calling thread will not be available to complete the DDE conversation, so it is important that <b>ShellExecuteEx</b> complete the conversation before returning control to the calling application. Failure to complete the conversation can result in an unsuccessful launch of the document.
  * 
  * If the calling thread has a message loop and will exist for some time after the call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecuteexa">ShellExecuteEx</a> returns, the <b>SEE_MASK_NOASYNC</b> flag is optional. If the flag is omitted, the calling thread's message pump will be used to complete the DDE conversation. The calling application regains control sooner, since the DDE conversation can be completed in the background.
  * 
  * For calls to this API that result from user interaction specify <b>SEE_MASK_FLAG_LOG_USAGE</b>.
  * 
  * To include double quotation marks in <b>lpParameters</b>, enclose each mark in a pair of quotation marks, as in the following example.
  * 
  * ``` cpp
  * sei.lpParameters = "An example: \"\"\"quoted text\"\"\"";
  * ```
  * 
  * In this case, the application receives three parameters: <i>An</i>, <i>example:</i>, and <i>"quoted text"</i>.
  * 
  * > [!NOTE]
  * > The shellapi.h header defines SHELLEXECUTEINFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
