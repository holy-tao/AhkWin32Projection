/**
 * Defines the set of health state values for a VDS object.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Health enumeration values apply to the VDS objects as shown in the following table. Y indicates that the value 
  *     applies to the object, and N indicates that the value does not apply to the object. A pack object does not 
  *     report health status.
