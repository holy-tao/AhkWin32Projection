/**
 * The VDS_STORAGE_POOL_PROP structure (vdshwprv.h) defines the properties of a storage pool object.
 * @remarks
 * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdsstoragepool-getproperties">IVdsStoragePool::GetProperties</a> returns this structure to report the properties of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/storage-pool-object">storage pool object</a>.
  * 
  * The following examples show how the <b>ullTotalConsumedSpace</b>, <b>ullTotalManagedSpace</b>, and <b>ullRemainingFreeSpace</b> members work together.
  * 
  * <h3><a id="Example_1"></a><a id="example_1"></a><a id="EXAMPLE_1"></a>Example 1</h3>
  * Suppose you have 2 drives of 1 TB each. Suppose further that you do the following:<ol>
  * <li>Create a storage pool as a mirror pool.</li>
  * <li>Create a LUN whose size is 200 GB.</li>
  * </ol>
  * 
  * 
  * <b>ullTotalConsumedSpace</b> = 2 TB. This is the amount of storage pool space  that is backed by physical storage or physical disks. Creating LUNs from the pool does not change this number.
  * 
  * <b>ullTotalManagedSpace</b> = 1 TB. This is the maximum size of the LUN or storage pool that can be created from this pool. Only 1 TB is available, because the pool type is a mirror with only 2 plexes. <div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If the pool type were RAID5, <b>ullTotalManagedSpace</b> would be (<i>N</i>-1)/<i>N</i> * <b>ullTotalConsumedSpace</b>, where <i>N</i> is the number of columns. For example, with 5 drives and 5 columns, <b>ullTotalManagedSpace</b> would be (5-1)/5 * <b>ullTotalConsumedSpace</b> or 1.6 TB.</div>
  * <div> </div>
  * 
  * 
  * <b>ullRemainingFreeSpace</b> = 800 GB (1 TB – 200 GB), because 200GB has already been allocated to a LUN.
  * 
  * (<b>ullTotalManagedSpace</b> -  <b>ullRemainingFreeSpace</b>) is the amount of managed space allocated to LUNs and pools created from this pool. In this example, <b>ullTotalManagedSpace</b> -  <b>ullRemainingFreeSpace</b> = 200 GB.
  * 
  * <h3><a id="Example_2"></a><a id="example_2"></a><a id="EXAMPLE_2"></a>Example 2</h3>
  * Suppose you have 2 drives of 1 TB each. Suppose further that you do the following:<ol>
  * <li>Create a storage pool as a mirror pool.</li>
  * <li>Create a thin-provisioned LUN whose size is 10 TB.</li>
  * </ol>
  * 
  * 
  * <b>ullProvisionedSpace</b> = 10 TB. This applies only to thin-provisioned pools. This is the total space provisioned for the pool. The total space consumed by the pool is less than or equal to the total space provisioned for the pool.
  * 
  * <b>ullTotalConsumedSpace</b> = 2 TB.
  * 
  * <b>ullTotalManagedSpace</b> = 1 TB.
  * 
  * <b>ullRemainingFreeSpace</b> = 1 TB minus the amount of  managed space currently backing the LUN.  <div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Although the LUN's size is 10 TB, there may be as little as 10 GB of managed space backing the LUN, in which case there would be 20 GB of consumed space backing the mirrored LUN.</div>
