/**
 * Defines the set of object status values for a volume.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * When the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vds/nf-vds-ivdspack-getproperties">IVdsPack::GetProperties</a> method returns a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vds/ns-vds-vds_pack_prop">VDS_PACK_PROP</a> structure whose <b>status</b> member is VDS_PS_OFFLINE, VDS sets the status for all the  volumes in the pack to VDS_VS_FAILED. VDS sets the status for specific volume types to VDS_VS_FAILED under the following conditions:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>For simple, spanned, and striped volumes—whenever a disk is missing.</li>
  * <li>For mirrored volumes—when any disk, except the last disk, is missing or has write errors that  the plex transitions to a detached condition. Likewise, if it is the last (non-stale) plex and the disk is missing.</li>
  * <li>For stripe with parity (RAID-5)—when the second disk is missing, or if one column becomes detached (because the disk is missing or the column has write errors), and a second disk is missing.</li>
  * </ul>
  * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vds/ns-vds-vds_volume_prop">VDS_VOLUME_PROP</a>structure includes a <b>VDS_VOLUME_STATUS</b> value as a member to indicate the status of a volume.
  * 
  * <div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Additional constants might be added to the <b>VDS_VOLUME_STATUS</b> enumeration in future Windows versions. For this reason, your application must be designed to gracefully handle an unrecognized <b>VDS_VOLUME_STATUS</b> enumeration constant.</div>
