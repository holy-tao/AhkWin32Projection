 * 
 * The case where the remote copy was deleted after the client copy was changed is a special case that produces an unexpected result.  The logical expectation is that the later operation (the remote deletion) propagates to the client and deletes the client copy from the cache.  However, the result is that the client copy is restored to the server, reversing the deletion.  This is because Offline Files is a client feature and therefore is unable to know when a remote copy of a cached item was deleted.  If the local copy is modified offline, the last-change time of that local copy will be later than the last-change time for the remote copy recorded when the item was last in sync.  Therefore, an <b>OFFLINEFILES_SYNC_CONFLICT_RESOLVE_KEEPLATEST</b> resolution finds the last-change time on the client copy to be later than the last-change time last known for the server copy.  This causes the local copy to be restored to the server.
