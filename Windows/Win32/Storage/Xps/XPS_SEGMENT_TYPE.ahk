/**
 * Describes a line segment.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * A geometry segment is described by the start point, the segment type, and additional parameters whose values are determined by the segment type. The coordinates for the start point of the first segment are a property of the geometry figure. The start point of each subsequent segment is the end point of the preceding segment.
  * 
  * The table that follows shows an example of each segment type.
