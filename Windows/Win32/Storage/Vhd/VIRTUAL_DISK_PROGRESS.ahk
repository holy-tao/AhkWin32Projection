/**
 * Contains the progress and result data for the current virtual hard disk (VHD) operation, used by the GetVirtualDiskOperationProgress function.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The <b>CurrentValue</b> and <b>CompletionValue</b> members are 
  *     intended to be used for calculating a percentage value, and the specific numeric values of each are not 
  *     significant in any way. Only the result of the following calculation is meaningful: 
  *     <b>CurrentValue</b> divided by <b>CompletionValue</b> multiplied by 100 
  *     equals percent complete, up to and including 100 percent, even when <b>OperationStatus</b> is 
  *     still returning <b>ERROR_IO_PENDING</b>. This percentage is not always guaranteed to increase 
  *     with subsequent calls to the 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/virtdisk/nf-virtdisk-getvirtualdiskoperationprogress">GetVirtualDiskOperationProgress</a> 
  *     function, and may decrease. These decreased percentages may be safely ignored if progress tracking is desired to 
  *     be only in the positive by locally storing the current maximum percentage.
  * 
  * The <b>CurrentValue</b> and <b>CompletionValue</b> members can vary in 
  *     subsequent calls to the 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/virtdisk/nf-virtdisk-getvirtualdiskoperationprogress">GetVirtualDiskOperationProgress</a> 
  *     function, so they must be used together at the same time from the same call. That is, it is not valid to save 
  *     either of them locally and then make another call to the 
  *     <b>GetVirtualDiskOperationProgress</b> 
  *     function expecting to use either of the previous values with the other value from the more recent call.
  * 
  * The <b>OperationStatus</b> member is the indicator of completion, not the percent-complete 
  *     calculation described previously. As long as this data member is returning with an 
  *     <b>ERROR_IO_PENDING</b> status code, the I/O operation is not yet complete.
  *
