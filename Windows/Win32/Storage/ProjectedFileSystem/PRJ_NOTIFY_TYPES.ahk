/**
 * Types of notifications describing a change to the file or folder.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * ProjFS can send notifications of file system activity to a provider. When the provider starts a virtualization instance it specifies which notifications it wishes to receive. It may also specify a new set of notifications for a file when it is created or renamed. The provider must register a PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB notification callback routine in the callbacks parameter of PrjStartVirtualizing in order to receive notifications. 
  * 
  * ProjFS sends notifications for files and directories within an active virtualization root. That is, ProjFS will send notifications for the virtualization root and its descendants. Symbolic links and junctions within the virtualization root are not traversed when determining what constitutes a descendant of the virtualization root. 
  * 
  * ProjFS sends notifications only for the primary data stream of a file. ProjFS does not send notifications for operations on alternate data streams. 
  * 
  * ProjFS does not send notifications for an inactive virtualization instance. A virtualization instance is inactive if any one of the following is true: 
  * 
  * - The provider has not yet started it by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nf-projectedfslib-prjstartvirtualizing">PrjStartVirtualizing</a>.
  * - The provider has stopped the instance by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nf-projectedfslib-prjstopvirtualizing">PrjStopVirtualizing</a>.
  * - The provider process has exited
  *  
  * The provider may specify which notifications it wishes to receive when starting a virtualization instance, or in response to a notification that allows a new notification mask to be set. 
  * 
  * The provider specifies a default set of notifications that it wants ProjFS to send for the virtualization instance when it starts the instance. This set of notifications is provided in the NotificationMappings member of the options parameter of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nf-projectedfslib-prjstartvirtualizing">PrjStartVirtualizing</a>, which may specify different notification masks for different subtrees of the virtualization instance. 
  * 
  * The provider may choose to supply a different notification mask in response to a notification of file open, create, supersede/overwrite, or rename. ProjFS will continue to send these notifications for the given file until all handles to the file are closed. After that it will revert to the default set of notifications. Naturally if the default set of notifications does not specify that ProjFS should notify for open, create, etc., the provider will not get the opportunity to specify a different mask for those operations.
