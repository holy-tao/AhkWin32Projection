/**
 * Describes the characteristics of a chunk.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The final three members (<b>idChunkSource</b>, <b>cwcStartSource</b>, and <b>cwcLenSource</b>) are used to describe the source of a derived chunk; that is, one that can be mapped back to a section of text. For example, the heading of a chapter can be both a text-type property and an internal value-type property ? a heading. The value-type property "heading" would be a derived chunk. If the text of the current value-type chunk (from an internal value-type property) is derived from some text-type chunk, then it must be emitted more than once.
  * 
  * The following segment is an example of how this might happen in a book.
  * 
  * The small detective exclaimed, "C'est fini!"
  * 
  * <b>Confessions</b>
  * 
  * The room was silent for several minutes. After thinking very hard about it, the young woman asked, "But how did you know?"
  * 
  * This segment might be broken into chunks in the following way.
  * 
  * <table>
  * <tr>
  * <th>ID</th>
  * <th>Text</th>
  * <th>BreakType</th>

  * Information provided by <b>idChunkSource</b>, <b>cwcStartSource</b>, and <b>cwcLenSource</b> is useful for a search engine that highlights hits. If the query is done for an internal value-type property, the search engine will highlight the original text from which the text of the internal value-type property has been derived. For instance, in a C++ code filter, the browser, when searching for MyFunction in internal value-type property "function definitions," will highlight the function header in the file.
