/**
 * Indicates the type of backup to be performed.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * An implementation of a backup type defined by a 
  *     <b>VSS_BACKUP_TYPE</b> value must be done using the VSS API.
  * 
  * This is particularly true in the case of incremental (<b>VSS_BT_INCREMENTAL</b>) and 
  *     differential (<b>VSS_BT_DIFFERENTIAL</b>) backups. In these cases, requesters and writers 
  *     work together using the file backup specification masks 
  *     (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vss/ne-vss-vss_file_spec_backup_type">VSS_FILE_SPEC_BACKUP_TYPE</a>), and designations of 
  *     files as being part of partial and differenced file operations to select which files must be backed up.
  * 
  * A requester may also use other more traditional techniques to implement an incremental or differential 
  *     restore, but it must not override the information provided through the VSS interfaces.
  * 
  * If a requester, when processing a given backup type, encounters a writer that does not support that backup 
  *     type, the requester performs backup or restore operations for that particular writer's data as if the backup type 
  *     was <b>VSS_BT_FULL</b>.
  * 
  * Requesters set the backup type with a call to 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setbackupstate">IVssBackupComponents::SetBackupState</a>.
  * 
  * Writers use 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-getbackuptype">CVssWriter::GetBackupType</a> to determine the 
  *     backup type.
