/**
 * Used by writers to indicate their support of certain backup operations.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * When a writer sets a backup-required value of the 
  *     <b>VSS_FILE_SPEC_BACKUP_TYPE</b> enumeration, it is 
  *     indicating that the requester perform the backup in such a way that, when the backup is restored, the current 
  *     version of the file set is restored. Typically, this means that the file set is copied as part of the backup.
  * 
  * This setting can be overridden if a file is added to the Backup Components Document as a differenced file 
  *     (using 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-adddifferencedfilesbylastmodifytime">IVssComponent::AddDifferencedFilesByLastModifyTime</a>) 
  *     or as a partial file (using 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-addpartialfile">IVssComponent::AddPartialFile</a>).
  * 
  * If a file is added as a differenced file, the writer establishes criteria by which the requester should decide 
  *     whether or not to actually copy a file to a backup medium. A writer typically adds differenced files to the Backup 
  *     Components Document for inclusion in a backup 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-p">PostSnapshot</a> event (see 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onpostsnapshot">CVssWriter::OnPostSnapshot</a>). See 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/incremental-and-differential-backups">Incremental and Differential Backups</a> 
  *     for details.
  * 
  * When a writer sets a shadow copy-required value of the 
  *     <b>VSS_FILE_SPEC_BACKUP_TYPE</b> enumeration, it 
  *     indicates that the file set should be backed up from a shadow-copied volume. File sets not tagged with a 
  *     shadow copy-required value can be backed up from the original volume.
  * 
  * Writers set <b>VSS_FILE_SPEC_BACKUP_TYPE</b> values 
  *     while handling an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VSS/vssgloss-i">Identify</a> event (see 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-onidentify">CVssWriter::OnIdentify</a>).
  * 
  * A bit mask (or bitwise OR) of 
  *     <b>VSS_FILE_SPEC_BACKUP_TYPE</b> values can be applied 
  *     to a file set when adding it to a component using the 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata-addfilestofilegroup">IVssCreateWriterMetadata::AddFilesToFileGroup</a>, 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata-adddatabasefiles">IVssCreateWriterMetadata::AddDatabaseFiles</a>, or 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata-adddatabaselogfiles">IVssCreateWriterMetadata::AddDatabaseLogFiles</a> 
  *     method.
  * 
  * If no explicit file specification backup type is supplied during the addition of a file specification to a 
  *     component, the specification is tagged with the default 
  *     <b>VSS_FILE_SPEC_BACKUP_TYPE</b> value:
  *     (VSS_FSBT_ALL_BACKUP_REQUIRED | VSS_FSBT_ALL_SNAPSHOT_REQUIRED).
  * 
  * Requesters or writers can recover a file set's file specification backup type by using the 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsswmfiledesc-getbackuptypemask">IVssWMFiledesc::GetBackupTypeMask</a> 
  *     method.
