/**
 * Defines the set of statuses of a file restore operation.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * If any files managed by a component or, if it defines a component set, any of its subcomponents cannot be 
  *     restored, the value of <b>VSS_FILE_RESTORE_STATUS</b> 
  *     must indicate an error.
  * 
  * Both the values <b>VSS_RS_FAILED</b> and <b>VSS_RS_NONE</b> indicate 
  *     that a restore operation did not complete successfully:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li><b>VSS_RS_NONE</b> indicates a restore failed gracefully: no files from the component 
  *       or its subcomponents were restored to disk.</li>
  * <li><b>VSS_RS_FAIL</b> indicates a restore failed gracelessly, leaving some files restored 
  *       to disk and some files unrestored.</li>
  * </ul>
  * Requesters must set a restore status (using 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setfilerestorestatus">IVssBackupComponents::SetFileRestoreStatus</a>) 
  *     for every component (and its component set, if it defines one) explicitly added for restore to the Backup 
  *     Components Document (using either 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setselectedforrestore">IVssBackupComponents::SetSelectedForRestore</a> or 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsbackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-addrestoresubcomponent">IVssBackupComponents::AddRestoreSubcomponent</a>).
  * 
  * Writers and requesters can query the status of the restoration of a component or a component set defined by a 
  *     selectable component with calls to 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vswriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getfilerestorestatus">IVssComponent::GetFileRestoreStatus</a>. If
  *     this method is called for a component that was not selected, the value returned is undefined.
