/**
 * Contains directory information for a file.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The <b>FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO</b> structure is a subset of the 
  *     information in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/ns-winbase-file_id_both_dir_info">FILE_ID_BOTH_DIR_INFO</a> structure. 
  *     If the additional information is not needed then the operation will be faster as it comes from the directory 
  *     entry; <b>FILE_ID_BOTH_DIR_INFO</b> contains information 
  *     from both the directory entry and the Master File Table (MFT).
  * 
  * No specific access rights are required to 
  *     query this information.
  * 
  * All dates and times are in absolute system-time format. Absolute system time is the number of 100-nanosecond 
  *     intervals since the start of the year 1601.
  * 
  * This <b>FILE_FULL_DIR_INFO</b> structure must be aligned 
  *     on a <b>LONGLONG</b> (8-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these 
  *     structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on an 
  *     8-byte boundary.
  * 
  * To compile an application that uses this structure, define the <b>_WIN32_WINNT</b> macro 
  *     as 0x0600 or later. For more information, see 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/using-the-windows-headers">Using the Windows Headers</a>.
