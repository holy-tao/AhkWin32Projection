/**
 * Contains information about files in the specified directory.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * No specific access rights are required to query this information.
  * 
  * File reference numbers, also called file IDs, are guaranteed to be unique only within a static file system. 
  *     They are not guaranteed to be unique over time, because file systems are free to reuse them. Nor are they 
  *     guaranteed to remain constant. For example, the FAT file system generates the file reference number for a file 
  *     from the byte offset of the file's directory entry record (DIRENT) on the disk. Defragmentation can change this 
  *     byte offset. Thus a FAT file reference number can change over time.
  * 
  * All dates and times are in absolute system-time format. Absolute system time is the number of 100-nanosecond 
  *     intervals since the start of the year 1601.
  * 
  * This <b>FILE_ID_BOTH_DIR_INFO</b> structure must be 
  *     aligned on a <b>DWORDLONG</b> (8-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the 
  *     <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on an 8-byte boundary.
