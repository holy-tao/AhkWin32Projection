/**
 * Contains information that the GetFileInformationByHandle function retrieves.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The identifier that is stored in the <b>nFileIndexHigh</b> and 
  *     <b>nFileIndexLow</b> members is called the file ID. Support for file IDs is file 
  *     system-specific. File IDs are not guaranteed to be unique over time, because file systems are free to reuse them. 
  *     In some cases, the file ID for a file can change over time.
  * 
  * In the FAT file system, the file ID is generated from the first cluster of the containing directory and the 
  *     byte offset within the directory of the entry for the file. Some defragmentation products change this byte offset. 
  *     (Windows in-box defragmentation does not.) Thus, a FAT file ID can change over time. Renaming a file in the FAT 
  *     file system can also change the file ID, but only if the new file name is longer than the old one.
  * 
  * In the NTFS file system, a file keeps the same file ID until it is deleted. You can replace one file with 
  *     another file without changing the file ID by using the 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-replacefilea">ReplaceFile</a> function. However, the file ID of the 
  *     replacement file, not the replaced file, is retained as the file ID of the resulting file.
  * 
  * Not all file systems can record creation and last access time, and not all file systems record them in the 
  *     same manner. For example, on a Windows FAT file system, create time has a resolution of 10 milliseconds, write 
  *     time has a resolution of 2 seconds, and access time has a resolution of 1 day (the access date). On the NTFS file 
  *     system, access time has a resolution of 1 hour. For more information, see 
  *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SysInfo/file-times">File Times</a>.
