First, it guarantees that the data returned by the sync provider is always persisted to the disk prior to it being returned to the user application. Second, it allows the sync provider to retrieve the same data it has returned previously to the platform and validate its integrity. Only upon a successful confirmation of the integrity by the sync provider will the platform complete the user I/O request. This modifier helps support end-to-end data integrity at the cost of extra disk I/Os.

 * This policy modifier grants the platform the permission to dehydrate in-sync cloud file placeholders without the help of sync providers. Without this flag, the platform is not allowed to call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/mt827480(v=vs.85)">CfDehydratePlaceholder</a> directly. Instead, the only supported way to dehydrate a cloud file placeholder is to clear the file’s pinned attribute and set the file’s unpinned attribute. At that point, the actual dehydration will be performed asynchronously by the sync engine after it receives the directory change notification on the two attributes. When this flag is specified, the platform will be allowed to invoke <b>CfDehydratePlaceholder</b> directly on any in-sync cloud file placeholder. It is recommended for sync providers to support auto-dehydration.
