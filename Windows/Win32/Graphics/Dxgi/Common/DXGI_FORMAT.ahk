 * Resource data formats, including fully-typed and typeless formats. A list of modifiers at the bottom of the page more fully describes each format type.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * <h3><a id="Byte_Order__LSB_MSB_"></a><a id="byte_order__lsb_msb_"></a><a id="BYTE_ORDER__LSB_MSB_"></a>Byte Order (LSB/MSB)</h3>
  * Most formats have byte-aligned components, and the components are in C-array order (the least address comes first).
  *             For those formats that don't have power-of-2-aligned components, the first named component is in the least-significant bits.

  * Rather than adjusting for whether a system uses big-endian or little-endian byte ordering, you should write portable code, as follows.
  *           
  * 
  * 
  * ```
  * 
  * // DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT
  * FLOAT* pR32G32B32A32 = ...;
  * pR32G32B32A32[0] = 1.f;  // R
  * pR32G32B32A32[1] = 0.f;  // G
  * pR32G32B32A32[2] = 0.f;  // B
  * pR32G32B32A32[3] = 0.5f; // A
  * 
  * // DXGI_FORMAT_R10G10B10A2_UNORM
  * UINT32* pR10G10B10A2 = ...;
  * pR10G10B10A2 = (0x3ff) | (0x1 << 30);  // R=0x3ff, and A=0x1

  * <h3><a id="Restrictions_and_notes_on_formats"></a><a id="restrictions_and_notes_on_formats"></a><a id="RESTRICTIONS_AND_NOTES_ON_FORMATS"></a>Restrictions and notes on formats</h3>
  * A few formats have additional restrictions and implied behavior:
  * 
  * <ol>
  * <li>A resource declared with the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32 family of formats cannot be used simultaneously for vertex and texture data.
  *               That is, you may not create a buffer resource with the DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32 family of formats that uses any of the following bind flags:
  *               D3D10_BIND_VERTEX_BUFFER, D3D10_BIND_INDEX_BUFFER, D3D10_BIND_CONSTANT_BUFFER, or D3D10_BIND_STREAM_OUTPUT
  *               (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d10/ne-d3d10-d3d10_bind_flag">D3D10_BIND_FLAG</a>).
  *             </li>
  * <li>DXGI_FORMAT_R1_UNORM is designed specifically for text filtering, and must be used with a format-specific, configurable 8x8 filter mode.
  *               When calling an HLSL sampling function using this format, the address offset parameter must be set to (0,0).
  *             </li>
  * <li>A resource using a sub-sampled format (such as DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8_B8G8) must have a size that is a multiple of 2 in the x dimension.
  *             </li>
  * <li>Format is not available in Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 10.1
  *             </li>
  * <li>These float formats have an implied 1 added to their mantissa. If the exponent is not 0, 1.0 is added to the mantissa before applying the exponent. </li>
  * <li>These float formats do not have an implied 1 added to their mantissa. </li>
  * <li>Denorm support: the 9, 10, 11 and 16 bit float formats support denorms.</li>
  * <li>No denorm support: the 32 and 64 bit float formats flush denorms to zero. </li>

  * <h3><a id="Format_Modifiers"></a><a id="format_modifiers"></a><a id="FORMAT_MODIFIERS"></a>Format Modifiers</h3>
  * Each enumeration value contains a format modifier which describes the data type.
  * 
  * <table>
  * <tr>
  * <th>Format Modifiers</th>
  * <th>Description</th>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td>_FLOAT</td>
  * <td>A floating-point value; 32-bit floating-point formats use IEEE 754 single-precision (s23e8 format): sign bit, 8-bit biased (127) exponent,
  *                 and 23-bit mantissa. 16-bit floating-point formats use half-precision (s10e5 format): sign bit, 5-bit biased (15) exponent, and 10-bit mantissa.
  *               </td>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td>_SINT</td>
  * <td>Two's complement signed integer. For example, a 3-bit SINT represents the values -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.</td>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td>_SNORM</td>
  * <td>Signed normalized integer; which is interpreted in a resource as a signed integer, and is interpreted in a shader as a signed normalized floating-point value in the range [-1, 1]. For an 2's complement number, the maximum value is 1.0f (a 5-bit value 01111 maps to 1.0f), and the minimum value is -1.0f (a 5-bit value 10000 maps to -1.0f). In addition, the second-minimum number maps to -1.0f (a 5-bit value 10001 maps to -1.0f). The resulting integer representations are evenly spaced floating-point values in the range (-1.0f...0.0f), and also a complementary set of representations for numbers in the range (0.0f...1.0f).</td>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td>_SRGB</td>
  * <td>
  * Standard RGB data, which roughly displays colors in a linear ramp of luminosity levels such that an average observer, under average viewing conditions, can view them on an average display.
  * 
  * All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f. The sequence of unsigned integer encodings between all 0's and all 1's represent a nonlinear progression in the floating-point interpretation of the numbers between 0.0f to 1.0f. For more detail, see the SRGB color standard, IEC 61996-2-1, at IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission).</p>Conversion to or from sRGB space is automatically done by D3DX10 or D3DX9 texture-load functions. If a format with _SRGB has an A channel, the A channel is stored in Gamma 1.0f data; the R, G, and B channels in the format are stored in Gamma 2.2f data.</td>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td>_TYPELESS</td>
  * <td>Typeless data, with a defined number of bits. Typeless formats are designed for creating typeless resources; that is, a resource whose size is known, but whose data type is not yet fully defined. When a typeless resource is bound to a shader, the application or shader must resolve the format type (which must match the number of bits per component in the typeless format).
  * 
  * A typeless format contains one or more subformats; each subformat resolves the data type. 
  *   For example, in the R32G32B32 group, which defines types for three-component 96-bit data, there is one typeless format and three fully typed subformats.

  * <tr>
  * <td>_UNORM</td>
  * <td>Unsigned normalized integer; which is interpreted in a resource as an unsigned integer, and is interpreted in a shader as an unsigned normalized floating-point value in the range [0, 1]. All 0's maps to 0.0f, and all 1's maps to 1.0f. A sequence of evenly spaced floating-point values from 0.0f to 1.0f are represented. For instance, a 2-bit UNORM represents 0.0f, 1/3, 2/3, and 1.0f.</td>

  * Direct3D 10 offers new data compression formats for compressing high-dynamic range (HDR) lighting data, normal maps and heightfields to a fraction of their original size. These compression types include:
  *           
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>Shared-Exponent high-dynamic range (HDR) format (RGBE)</li>
  * <li>New Block-Compressed 1-2 channel UNORM/SNORM formats</li>
  * </ul>
  * The block compression formats can be used for any of the 2D or 3D texture types ( Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture3D, or TextureCube) including mipmap surfaces. The block compression techniques require texture dimensions to be a multiple of 4 (since the implementation compresses on blocks of 4x4 texels). In the texture sampler, compressed formats are always decompressed before texture filtering.

    /**
     * 8-bit per channel planar YUV 4:2:0 video resource format. This format is subsampled where each pixel has its own Y value, but each 2x2 pixel block shares a single U and V value. The runtime requires that the width and height of all resources that are created with this format are multiples of 2. The runtime also requires that the left, right, top, and bottom members of any RECT that are used for this format are multiples of 2. This format differs from DXGI_FORMAT_NV12 in that the layout of the data within the resource is completely opaque to applications. Applications cannot use the CPU to map the resource and then access the data within the resource. You cannot use shaders with this format. Because of this behavior, legacy hardware that supports a non-NV12 4:2:0 layout (for example, YV12, and so on) can be used. Also, new hardware that has a 4:2:0 implementation better than NV12 can be used when the application does not need the data to be in a standard layout.
