/**
 * The WmfPlaceableFileHeader structure defines the fields of a placeable metafile header. Placeable metafiles were created as a way of specifying how a metafile is mapped and scaled on a display device.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Although placeable metafiles are quite common, they are not directly supported by the Windows API. To display a placeable metafile using the Windows API, you must first strip the placeable metafile header from the file. This is typically performed by copying the metafile to a temporary file starting at file offset 22 (0x16). This is because each placeable metafile begins with a 22-byte header that is followed by a standard metafile.
