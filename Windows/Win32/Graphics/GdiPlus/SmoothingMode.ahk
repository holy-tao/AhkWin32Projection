/**
 * The SmoothingMode enumeration specifies the type of smoothing (antialiasing) that is applied to lines and curves. This enumeration is used by the Graphics::GetSmoothingMode and Graphics::SetSmoothingMode methods of the Graphics class.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Smoothing performed by an 8 X 4 box filter gives better results for nearly vertical lines than it does for nearly horizontal lines. Smoothing performed by an 8 X 8 box filter gives equally good results for nearly vertical and nearly horizontal lines. The 8x8 algorithm produces higher quality smoothing but is slower than the 8 X 4 algorithm.
