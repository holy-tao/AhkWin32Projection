/**
 * Represents an image.
 * @remarks
 * Optional.
  * 
  * May occur one or more times for each [**Command.SmallImages**](windowsribbon-element-command-smallimages.md), [**Command.SmallHighContrastImages**](windowsribbon-element-command-smallhighcontrastimages.md), [**Command.LargeImages**](windowsribbon-element-command-largeimages.md), or [**Command.LargeHighContrastImages**](windowsribbon-element-command-largehighcontrastimages.md) element.
  * 
  * When a collection of image resources that are designed to support specific screen dots per inch (dpi) settings is supplied to the Ribbon framework through a set of **Image** elements, the framework uses the **Image** with a *MinDPI* attribute value that matches the current screen dpi setting.
  * 
  * If no **Image** element is declared with a *MinDPI* value that matches the current screen dpi setting, the framework picks the **Image** that has the nearest *MinDPI* value less than the current screen dpi setting and scales the image resource up. Otherwise, if no **Image** element is declared with a *MinDPI* attribute value less than the current screen dpi setting, the framework picks the nearest *MinDPI* value greater than the current screen dpi setting and scales the image resource down.
