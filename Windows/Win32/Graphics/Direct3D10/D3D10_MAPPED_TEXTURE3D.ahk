/**
 * Provides access to subresource data in a 3D texture.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * This structure is used to access subresource data when calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d10/nf-d3d10-id3d10texture3d-map">ID3D10Texture3D::Map</a>. To access data, you must cast the <b>pData</b> pointer; see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d10/ns-d3d10-d3d10_mapped_texture2d">D3D10_MAPPED_TEXTURE2D</a> for an example.
  * 
  * To illustrate pitch for an uncompressed texture, assume a 3D texture with mipmap levels, as shown in the following illustration.
  * 
  * <img alt="Illustration of a 3D texture with mipmap levels" src="./images/d3d10_resource_texture3d.png"/>
  * 
  * It is easiest to consider the top-level texture only, as shown in the following illustration.
  * 
  * <img alt="Illustration of only the top-level texture" src="./images/d3d10_3d_texture_1.png"/>
  * 
  * And then visualize the top-level texture redrawn as a series of 2D textures, each one having a different depth value. This yields several texture planes, as shown in the following illustration.
  * 
  * <img alt="Illustration of top-level texture drawn as 2D texture planes" src="./images/d3d10_3d_texture_conceptual.png"/>
  * 
  * However, the actual layout of all the elements from all the texture planes looks more like the following illustration.
  * 
  * <img alt="Illustration of the row pitch and depth pitch in memory" src="./images/d3d10_3d_texture_memory.png"/>
  * 
  * Use row pitch to advance a pointer between rows within a single 2D texture plane; use depth pitch to advance a pointer between 2D texture planes.
