/**
 * Defines how the world transform, dots per inch (dpi), and stroke width affect the shape of the pen used to stroke a primitive.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * If you specify <b>D2D1_STROKE_TRANSFORM_TYPE_FIXED</b> the stroke isn't affected by the world transform.
  * 
  * If you specify <b>D2D1_STROKE_TRANSFORM_TYPE_FIXED</b> the application has the same behavior in Windows 7 and later.
  * 
  * If you specify <b>D2D1_STROKE_TRANSFORM_TYPE_HAIRLINE</b> the stroke is always 1 pixel wide.
  * 
  * Apart from the stroke, any value derived from the stroke width is not affected when the transformType is either fixed or hairline. This includes miters, line caps and so on.
  * 
  *  
  * 
  * It is important to distinguish between the geometry being stroked and the shape of the stroke pen. When D2D1_STROKE_TRANSFORM_TYPE_FIXED or D2D1_STROKE_TRANSFORM_TYPE_HAIRLINE is specified, the geometry still respects the transform and dpi, but the pen that traces the geometry will not.
  * 
  * Here is an illustration of a stroke with dashing and a skew and stretch transform.

  * And here is an illustration of a fixed width stroke which does not get transformed.
