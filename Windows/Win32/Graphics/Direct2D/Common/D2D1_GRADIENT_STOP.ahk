/**
 * Contains the position and color of a gradient stop.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Gradient stops can be specified in any order if they are at different positions. Two stops may share a position. In this case, the first stop specified is treated as the "low" stop (nearer 0.0f) and subsequent stops are treated as "higher" (nearer 1.0f). This behavior is useful if a caller wants an instant transition in the middle of a stop.
  * 
  * Typically, there are at least two points in a collection, although creation with only one stop is permitted. For example, one point is at position 0.0f, another point is at position 1.0f, and additional points are distributed in the [0, 1] range. Where the gradient progression is beyond the range of [0, 1], the stops are stored, but may affect the gradient. 
  * 
  * When drawn, the [0, 1] range of positions is mapped to the brush, in a brush-dependent way. For details, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/d2d1/nn-d2d1-id2d1lineargradientbrush">ID2D1LinearGradientBrush</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/d2d1/nn-d2d1-id2d1radialgradientbrush">ID2D1RadialGradientBrush</a>. 
  * 
  * Gradient stops with a position outside the [0, 1] range cannot be seen explicitly, but they can still affect the colors produced in the [0, 1] range. For example, a two-stop gradient {{0.0f, Black}, {2.0f, White}} is indistinguishable visually from {{0.0f, Black}, {1.0f, Mid-level gray}}. Also, the colors are clamped before interpolation.
