/**
 * Describes Direct3D 11.1 feature options in the current graphics driver.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * If a Microsoft Direct3D device supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">feature level</a> 11.1 (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3dcommon/ne-d3dcommon-d3d_feature_level">D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_1</a>), when you call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/nf-d3d11-id3d11device-checkfeaturesupport">ID3D11Device::CheckFeatureSupport</a> with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_feature">D3D11_FEATURE_D3D11_OPTIONS</a>, <b>CheckFeatureSupport</b> returns a pointer to <b>D3D11_FEATURE_DATA_D3D11_OPTIONS</b> with all member set to <b>TRUE</b> except the <b>SAD4ShaderInstructions</b> and <b>ExtendedDoublesShaderInstructions</b> members, which are optionally supported by the hardware and driver and therefore can be <b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b>.
  * 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">Feature level</a> 11.1 provides the following additional features:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>UAVs at every shader stage with 64 UAV bind slots instead of 8.</li>
  * <li>Target-independent rasterization, which enables you to set the <b>ForcedSampleCount</b> member of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d11_1/ns-d3d11_1-cd3d11_rasterizer_desc1">D3D11_RASTERIZER_DESC1</a> to 1, 4, 8, or 16 and to render to RTVs with a single sample.</li>
  * <li>UAV-only rendering with the <b>ForcedSampleCount</b> member of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d11_1/ns-d3d11_1-cd3d11_rasterizer_desc1">D3D11_RASTERIZER_DESC1</a> set to up to 16 (only up to 8 for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d11/overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro">feature level</a> 11).</li>
  * </ul>
  * The runtime always sets the following groupings of members identically. That is, all the values in a grouping are <b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b> together:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li><b>DiscardAPIsSeenByDriver</b> and <b>FlagsForUpdateAndCopySeenByDriver</b></li>
  * <li><b>ClearView</b>, <b>CopyWithOverlap</b>, <b>ConstantBufferPartialUpdate</b>, <b>ConstantBufferOffsetting</b>, and <b>MapNoOverwriteOnDynamicConstantBuffer</b></li>
  * <li><b>MapNoOverwriteOnDynamicBufferSRV</b> and <b>MultisampleRTVWithForcedSampleCountOne</b></li>
  * </ul>
