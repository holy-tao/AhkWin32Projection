#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0.0 64-bit

/**
 * Defines the drag-and-drop interaction states for the viewport.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * For each interaction, the status always starts at <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_READY</b> and ends at either <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_CANCELLED</b> or <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_COMMITTED</b>. There are no explicit callbacks for the transition from CANCELLED/COMMITTED to READY.
  * 
  * 
  * The meaning of the CANCELLED and COMMITED values depend on the previous status.
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>For <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_PRESELECT</b>, they mean the same thing: the content goes back to the original location and no other actions should be taken.</li>
  * <li>FOR <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_SELECTING</b>, COMMITED means apply the selection change; CANCELLED means avoid the selection change.</li>
  * <li>For <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_DRAG_DROP_DRAGGING</b>, COMMITED means perform the drop action; CANCELLED means cancel the drop action.</li>
  * </ul>
