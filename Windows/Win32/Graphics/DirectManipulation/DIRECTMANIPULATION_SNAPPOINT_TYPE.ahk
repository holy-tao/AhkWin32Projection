 * Modifies how the final inertia end position is calculated.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * For <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_SNAPPOINT_MANDATORY</b> or <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_SNAPPOINT_OPTIONAL</b> snap points, the snap points are chosen based on the natural ending position of inertia as calculated by the touch interaction engine. For <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_SNAPPOINT_MANDATORY_SINGLE</b> or <b>DIRECTMANIPULATION_SNAPPOINT_OPTIONAL_SINGLE</b> snap points, the selected snap point depends on where inertia started.
