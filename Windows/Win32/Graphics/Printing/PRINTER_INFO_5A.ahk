     * | PRINTER\_ATTRIBUTE\_ENABLE\_DEVQ        | If set, **DevQueryPrint** is called. **DevQueryPrint** may fail if the document and printer setups do not match. Setting this flag causes mismatched documents to be held in the queue. |
     * | PRINTER\_ATTRIBUTE\_HIDDEN              | Reserved.                                                                                                                                                                               |

     * | PRINTER\_ATTRIBUTE\_QUEUED              | If set, the printer spools and starts printing after the last page is spooled. If not set and PRINTER\_ATTRIBUTE\_DIRECT is not set, the printer spools and prints while spooling.      |
     * | PRINTER\_ATTRIBUTE\_RAW\_ONLY           | Indicates that only raw data type print jobs can be spooled.                                                                                                                            |
