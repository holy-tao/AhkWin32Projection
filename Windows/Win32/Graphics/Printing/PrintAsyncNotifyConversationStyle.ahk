 * Specifies whether communication is bidirectional or unidirectional between applications and Print Spooler-hosted components such as printer drivers, print processors, and port monitors.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Even when the communication is bidirectional, applications cannot initiate communication. They can only reply to notifications sent by the Print Spooler-hosted components.
  * 
  * When multiple applications listen for bidirectional notifications, they receive only the first notification sent through a bidirectional channel. The Print Spooler maintains the channel only with the first listening application that responded, and discards all subsequent replies from other listeners.
