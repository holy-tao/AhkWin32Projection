/**

  * This enum is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12sdklayers/ns-d3d12sdklayers-d3d12_debug_device_gpu_based_validation_settings">D3D12_DEBUG_DEVICE_GPU_BASED_VALIDATION_SETTINGS</a> structure.
  * 
  * Generally speaking most application developers are likely to leave this parameter unchanged.  However, if the overhead of deferring patched PSO creation is suspected to be too much of a performance problem, then developers should consider changing this setting.
