This flexibility helps improve the traversal efficiency of acceleration structures in certain cases.  For instance, if the acceleration structure is implemented internally with bounding volumes, the implementation may find it beneficial to store relatively long triangles in multiple bounding boxes rather than a larger single box. However, some application use cases require that intersections be reported to the any hit shader at most once. This flag enables that guarantee for the given geometry, potentially with some performance impact.
