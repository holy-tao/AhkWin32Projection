#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0.0 64-bit

/**
 * Identifies the tier level at which tiled resources are supported.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * This enum is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_feature_data_d3d12_options">D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS</a> structure.
  *       
  * 
  * There are three discrete pieces of functionality bundled together for tiled resource functionality:
  *         
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>A tile-based texture layout option where nearby texel addresses contain nearby data coordinates.
  *             A tile of texels contains nearly the same amount of texels in each cardinal dimension of the resource.
  *             This layout is represented in D3D12 by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_texture_layout">D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_64KB_UNDEFINED_SWIZZLE</a>.
  *           </li>
  * <li>Reserve a region of virtual address space for a resource, where each page is initially NULL-mapped.
  *             In D3D12, this is operation is encapsulated within <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createreservedresource">ID3D12Device::CreateReservedResource</a>,
  *             which only works with textures that have the D3D12_TEXTURE_LAYOUT_64KB_UNDEFINED_SWIZZLE layout.
  *           </li>
  * <li>The ability to change page mappings and manipulate texture data on tile granularities.
  *             In D3D12, these operations are
  *             <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12commandqueue-updatetilemappings">ID3D12CommandQueue::UpdateTileMappings</a>,
  *             <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12commandqueue-copytilemappings">ID3D12CommandQueue::CopyTileMappings</a>, and
  *             <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12graphicscommandlist-copytiles">ID3D12GraphicsCommandList::CopyTiles</a>.
  *           </li>
  * </ul>
  * Three significant changes over D3D11 are:
  *         
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>Tile pools are replaced by heaps.
  *             Heaps provide a superset of capabilities than D3D11 tile pools do.
  *           </li>
  * <li>Reserved resources may be mapped to pages from multiple heaps at the same time.
  *             The D3D11 restriction that all non-NULL mapped pages must come from the same heap does not exist.
  *           </li>
  * <li>Applications should be aware of GPU virtual address capabilities, which enable litmus tests for particular usage scenarios.
  *             See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_feature">D3D12_FEATURE_GPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_SUPPORT</a>.
  *           </li>
  * </ul>
