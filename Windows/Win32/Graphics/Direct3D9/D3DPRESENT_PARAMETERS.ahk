     * 
     * In fact, D3DFMT\_UNKNOWN can be specified for the **BackBufferFormat** while in windowed mode. This tells the runtime to use the current display-mode format and eliminates the need to call [**GetDisplayMode**](/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-getdisplaymode).
     * 
     * For windowed applications, the back buffer format no longer needs to match the display-mode format because color conversion can now be done by the hardware (if the hardware supports color conversion). The set of possible back buffer formats is constrained, but the runtime will allow any valid back buffer format to be presented to any desktop format. (There is the additional requirement that the device be operable in the desktop; devices typically do not operate in 8 bits per pixel modes.)

     * 
     * - In Direct3D9Ex, D3DSWAPEFFECT\_FLIPEX is added to designate when an application is adopting flip mode. That is, whan an application's frame is passed in window's mode (instead of copied) to the Desktop Window Manager(DWM) for composition. Flip mode provides more efficient memory bandwidth and enables an application to take advantage of full-screen-present statistics. It does not change full screen behavior. Flip mode behavior is available beginning with Windows 7.
