/**
 * The ABCFLOAT structure contains the A, B, and C widths of a font character.

 * 
  * The A, B, and C widths are measured along the base line of the font.
  * 
  * The character increment (total width) of a character is the sum of the A, B, and C spaces. Either the A or the C space can be negative to indicate underhangs or overhangs.
