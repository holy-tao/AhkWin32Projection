/**
 * The GCP_RESULTS structure contains information about characters in a string. This structure receives the results of the GetCharacterPlacement function. For some languages, the first element in the arrays may contain more, language-dependent information. (Unicode)
 * @remarks
 * Whether the <b>lpGlyphs</b>, <b>lpOutString</b>, or neither is required depends on the results of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-getfontlanguageinfo">GetFontLanguageInfo</a> call.
  * 
  * In the case of a font for a language such as English, in which none of the GCP_DBCS, GCP_REORDER, GCP_GLYPHSHAPE, GCP_LIGATE, GCP_DIACRITIC, or GCP_KASHIDA flags are returned, neither of the arrays is required for proper operation. (Though not required, they can still be used. If the <b>lpOutString</b> array is used, it will be exactly the same as the <i>lpInputString</i> passed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-getcharacterplacementa">GetCharacterPlacement</a>.) Note, however, that if GCP_MAXEXTENT is used, then <b>lpOutString</b> will contain the truncated string if it is used, NOT an exact copy of the original.
  * 
  * In the case of fonts for languages such as Hebrew, which DO have reordering but do not typically have extra glyph shapes, <b>lpOutString</b> should be used. This will give the string on the screen-readable order. However, the <b>lpGlyphs</b> array is not typically needed. (Hebrew can have extra glyphs, if the font is a TrueType/Open font.)
  * 
  * In the case of languages such as Thai or Arabic, in which <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-getfontlanguageinfo">GetFontLanguageInfo</a> returns the GCP_GLYPHSHAPE flag, the <b>lpOutString</b> will give the display-readable order of the string passed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-getcharacterplacementa">GetCharacterPlacement</a>, but the values will still be the unshaped characters. For proper display, the <b>lpGlyphs</b> array must be used.

Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors.

    /**
     * A pointer to the array that receives the values identifying the glyphs used for rendering the string or is <b>NULL</b> if glyph rendering is not needed. The number of glyphs in the array may be less than the number of characters in the original string if the string contains ligated glyphs. Also if reordering is required, the order of the glyphs may not be sequential.
     * 
     * This array is useful if more than one operation is being done on a string which has any form of ligation, kerning or order-switching. Using the values in this array for subsequent operations saves the time otherwise required to generate the glyph indices each time.
     * 
     * This array always contains glyph indices and the ETO_GLYPH_INDEX value must always be used when this array is used with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-exttextouta">ExtTextOut</a> function.
     * 
     * When GCP_LIGATE is used, you can limit the number of characters that will be ligated together. (In Arabic for example, three-character ligations are common). This is done by setting the maximum required in lpGcpResults-&gt;lpGlyphs[0]. If no maximum is required, you should set this field to zero.
     * 
     * For languages such as Arabic, where <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-getfontlanguageinfo">GetFontLanguageInfo</a> returns the GCP_GLYPHSHAPE flag, the glyphs for a character will be different depending on whether the character is at the beginning, middle, or end of a word. Typically, the first character in the input string will also be the first character in a word, and the last character in the input string will be treated as the last character in a word. However, if the displayed string is a subset of the complete string, such as when displaying a section of scrolled text, this may not be true. In these cases, it is desirable to force the first or last characters to be shaped as not being initial or final forms. To do this, again, the first location in the <b>lpGlyphs</b> array is used by performing an OR operation of the ligation value above with the values GCPGLYPH_LINKBEFORE and/or GCPGLYPH_LINKAFTER. For example, a value of GCPGLYPH_LINKBEFORE | 2 means that two-character ligatures are the maximum required, and the first character in the string should be treated as if it is in the middle of a word.
