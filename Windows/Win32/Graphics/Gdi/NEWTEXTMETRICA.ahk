 * 
  * The last four members of the <b>NEWTEXTMETRIC</b> structure are not included in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-textmetrica">TEXTMETRIC</a> structure; in all other respects, the structures are identical.

  * > The wingdi.h header defines NEWTEXTMETRIC as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors.

For example, GDI makes a string bold by expanding the spacing of each character and overstriking by an offset value; it italicizes a font by shearing the string. In either case, there is an overhang past the basic string. For bold strings, the overhang is the distance by which the overstrike is offset. For italic strings, the overhang is the amount the top of the font is sheared past the bottom of the font.
