/**
 * Represents the style of a font face as normal, italic, or oblique.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Three terms categorize the slant of a font: normal, italic, and oblique.
  *   
  * 
  * <table>
  * <tr>
  * <th>Font style</th>
  * <th>Description</th>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td>Normal</td>
  * <td>The characters in a normal, or roman, font are upright. 
  * </td>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td>Italic 
  * </td>
  * <td>The characters in an italic font are truly slanted and appear as they were designed. 
  * </td>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td>Oblique</td>
  * <td>The characters in an oblique font are artificially slanted.</td>
  * </tr>
  * </table>
  *  
  * 
  * For Oblique, the slant is achieved by performing a shear transformation on the characters from a normal font. When a true italic font is not available on a computer or printer, an oblique style can be generated from the normal font and used to simulate an italic font. 
  * 
  * The following illustration shows the normal, italic, and oblique font styles for the Palatino Linotype font. Notice how the italic font style has a more flowing and visually appealing appearance than the oblique font style, which is simply created by skewing the normal font style version of the text.
