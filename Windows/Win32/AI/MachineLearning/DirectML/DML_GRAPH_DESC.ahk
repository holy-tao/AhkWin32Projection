/**
 * Describes a graph of DirectML operators used to compile a combined, optimized operator.
 * @remarks
 * The graph described by this structure must be a directed acyclic graph. You must define a connection for the input and output of each supplied node, except for inputs and outputs that are optional for the associated operator.
  * 
  * Nodes may use operators that were created using the [DML_TENSOR_FLAG_OWNED_BY_DML](/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_tensor_flags) flag for certain inputs. Any operator inputs using this flag must be connected to graph inputs. All operator inputs connected to the same graph input must use or omit this flag equivalently.
  * 
  * It is legal to connect operators whose connected inputs and outputs use different dimension counts, sizes, and data types. This implies that the tensor data blob is interpreted differently by each operator. The *TotalTensorSizeInBytes* field of connected tensor inputs and outputs must be identical, though. Operators should only read regions of tensors written by earlier operators. Any padding regions in the output of an operation (resulting from the use of strides) are not guaranteed to be read as zero by down-stream operators.
