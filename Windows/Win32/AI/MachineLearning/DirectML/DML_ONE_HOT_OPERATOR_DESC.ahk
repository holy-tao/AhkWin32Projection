     * Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***
     * 
     * A tensor containing the index in elements of the *OnValue*, for each sequence along the *Axis*. Indices are measured relative to the beginning of their sequence (as opposed to the beginning of the tensor). For example, an index of 0 always refers to the first element for all sequences in an axis.
     * 
     * If an index value for a sequence exceeds the number of elements along the *Axis* dimension in the *OutputTensor*, then that index value is ignored, and all elements in that sequence will be set to *OffValue*.
     * 
     * Starting with `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`, this operator supports negative index values when using a signed integral type with this tensor. Negative indices are interpreted as being relative to the end of the sequence. For example, an index of -1 refers to the last element in the sequence.
     * 
     * This tensor must have dimension count and sizes equal to the *OutputTensor*, *except* for the dimension specified by the *Axis* parameter. The size of the *Axis* dimension must be 1. For example if the *OutputTensor* has sizes of `{2,3,4,5}` and *Axis* is 1, the sizes of the *IndicesTensor* must be `{2,1,4,5}`.
