     * > Because this feature query only ever returns one of the values supplied in *RequestedFeatureLevels*, it's possible that the device supports an even higher feature level than the one returned by this query.
     * 
     * For example, DirectML version `1.4.0` supports a feature level of `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`. If the *RequestedFeatureLevels* array contained only `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0` and `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0`, then this query would return `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0`, which is lower than the true feature level (3_0) supported by the device.
