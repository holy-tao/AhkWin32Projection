/**
 * SOCKET_ADDRESS structure stores protocol-specific address information.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/sockaddr-2">SOCKADDR</a> structure pointed to by the <b>lpSockaddr</b> member varies depending on the protocol or address family selected. For example, the <b>sockaddr_in6</b> structure is used for an IPv6 socket address while the <b>sockaddr_in4</b> structure is used for an IPv4 socket address. The address family is the first member of all of the <b>SOCKADDR</b> structures. The address family is used to determine which structure is used. 
  * 
  * On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for WindowsÂ Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the <b>SOCKET_ADDRESS</b> structure is defined in the <i>Ws2def.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ws2def.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Winsock2.h</i>, and should never be used directly.
