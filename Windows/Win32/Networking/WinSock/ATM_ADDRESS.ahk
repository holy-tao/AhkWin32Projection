/**
 * The ATM_ADDRESS structure holds ATM address data for ATM-based sockets.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * For ATM_E164, enter the numbered digits in the same order in which they would be entered on a numeric keypad; that is, the number digit that would be entered first is located in <b>addr</b>. Digits are coded in IA5 characters. Bit 8 is set to zero.
  * 
  * For ATM_NSAP, code the address using Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) as defined in the ATM Forum UNI 3.1. The <b>NumofDigits</b> field is ignored in this case, and the NSAP-style address always contains 20 bytes.
  * 
  * A value of SAP_FIELD_ANY in <b>AddressType</b> indicates that the <b>satm_number</b> field is a wildcard. There are two more specialized wildcard values: SAP_FIELD_ANY_AESA_SEL and SAP_FIELD_ANY_AESA_REST. SAP_FIELD_ANY_AESA_SEL means that this is an NSAP-style ATM Endsystem Address and the selector octet is set as a wildcard. SAP_FIELD_ANY_AESA_REST means that this is an NSAP-style ATM Endsystem Address and all the octets except for the selector octet are set as wildcards.
