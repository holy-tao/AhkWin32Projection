/**
 * The SOCKADDR structure is a generic structure that specifies a transport address.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The SOCKADDR structure is large enough to contain a transport address for most address families. For a
  *     structure that is guaranteed to be large enough to contain a transport address for all possible address
  *     families, see 
  *     [SOCKADDR_STORAGE](./ns-ws2def-sockaddr_storage_lh.md).
  * 
  * A WSK application typically does not access the 
  *     <b>sa_data</b> member directly. Instead, a pointer to a SOCKADDR structure is normally cast to a pointer
  *     to the specific SOCKADDR structure type that corresponds to a particular address family.
  * 
  *
