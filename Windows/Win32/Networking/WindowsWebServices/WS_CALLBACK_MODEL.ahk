 * 
  * Whether a callback will be invoked long or short is up to the caller implementation.
  *                 The channel and listener implementations provide a way to control this for async callbacks
  *                 via the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_channel_property_id">WS_CHANNEL_PROPERTY_ASYNC_CALLBACK_MODEL</a> and

 *                 
 * 
 * When a callback is invoked short, it should avoid lengthy computation or lengthy
 *                     blocking calls so that it can return to the caller quickly.  During the time
 *                     that a callback is executing short, other work items may not be able to be
 *                     dequeued within the process.  This can lead to starvation deadlock, an
 *                     unresponsive system, or an underutilized system.
 *                 
 * 
 * If it is necessary to do IO within a callback that was invoked short, the best practice is
 *                     to use asynchronous IO (instead of synchronous IO), to avoid lengthy blocking calls.

 *                 
 * 
 * A callback invoked long is not required to return to the caller quickly.
 *                 
 * 
 * However, long callbacks are a limited resource, so it is not always possible
 *                     to invoke a callback long.
 *                 
 * 
 * Before invoking a callback long, the caller must ensure that there is another thread
 *                     available to dequeue work as necessary.  For example, if a caller needs to create 
 *                     a thread but is unable to, then it must invoke the callback short.
 *                 
 * 
 * All callbacks must be able to deal with being invoked short as well as long:
 *                     <ul>
 * <li>A callback that is invoked short but requires long can interpret this as an
 *                         error condition, likely due to low resources.  For example, calling CreateThread or
 *                         QueueUserWorkItem in this situation is also likely to fail.  If a
 *                         callback is required to run long in a low resource situation, then a thread
 *                         for this purpose must be reserved prior to initiating the async operation.
 *                         </li>
 * <li>A callback that is invoked long but expects short can go about its work normally.
 *                     </li>
 * </ul>
