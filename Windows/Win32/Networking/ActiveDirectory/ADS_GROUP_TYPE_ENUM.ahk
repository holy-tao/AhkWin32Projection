 * 
  * Because VBScript cannot read data from a type library, VBScript applications do not understand recognize constants, as defined above. Use the numerical constants, instead, to set the appropriate flags in your VBScript application. To use the symbolic constants as a good programming practice, write explicit declarations of such constants, as done here, in your VBScript application.
