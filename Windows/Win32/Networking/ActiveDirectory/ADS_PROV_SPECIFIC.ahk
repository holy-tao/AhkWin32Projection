/**
 * The ADS_PROV_SPECIFIC structure contains provider-specific data represented as a binary large object (BLOB).
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The <b>ADS_PROV_SPECIFIC</b> structure is one of the data types used as a member of the  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iads/ns-iads-adsvalue">ADSVALUE</a> structure definition. The data is represented as a BLOB here, although the actual data can be packed in any format, such as a C structure. The provider writer must publish the specific data format under the BLOB.
  * 
  * ADSI may also return attributes as <b>ADS_PROV_SPECIFIC</b> if unable to determine the correct attribute syntax type as would occur if, for example, the schema was unavailable.
