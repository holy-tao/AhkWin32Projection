#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0.0 64-bit

/**
 * Specifies the available options for examining security data of an object.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The options defined in this enumeration are bit-masks. More than one option can be set using appropriate bitwise operations.
  * 
  * To read the security data for an object, use the  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/iads/nn-iads-iadsobjectoptions">IADsObjectOptions</a> interface, supplying the security data options listed in this enumeration.
  * 
  * The following list lists common flag combinations and their use.
  * 
  * <table>
  * <tr>
  * <th>Flag combination</th>
  * <th>Description</th>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td><b>ADS_SECURITY_INFO_OWNER</b>, <b>ADS_SECURITY_INFO_GROUP</b>, and <b>ADS_SECURITY_INFO_DACL</b></td>
  * <td>Enable users to read the security data of the owner, group, or DACL of an object. This is the default setting when an object is created.</td>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td><b>ADS_SECURITY_INFO_OWNER</b>, <b>ADS_SECURITY_INFO_GROUP</b>, <b>ADS_SECURITY_INFO_DACL</b>, and <b>ADS_SECURITY_INFO_SACL</b></td>
  * <td>Enable users to read the SACL. The <b>ADS_SECURITY_INFO_SACL</b> flag cannot be used by itself.</td>
  * </tr>
  * </table>
  * Â 
  * 
  * Presently, such options are available for Active Directory only.
  * 
  * Because Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) cannot read data from a type library, an application must use the appropriate numeric constants, instead of the symbolic constants, to set the appropriate flags. To use the symbolic constants as a good programming practice, write explicit declarations of such constants, as done here.
