/**
 * Specifies authentication options used in ADSI for binding to directory service objects.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The <b>ADS_SECURE_AUTHENTICATION</b> flag can be used in combination with other flags such 
  *     as <b>ADS_READONLY_SERVER</b>, <b>ADS_PROMPT_CREDENTIALS</b>, 
  *     <b>ADS_FAST_BIND</b>, and so on.
  * 
  * Serverless binding refers to a process in which a client attempts to bind to an Active Directory object 
  *     without explicitly specifying an Active Directory server in the binding string. This is possible because the LDAP 
  *     provider relies on the locator services of Windows to find the best domain controller (DC) for the client. 
  *     However, the client must have an account on the Active Directory domain controller to take advantage of the 
  *     serverless binding feature, and the DC used by a serverless bind will always be located in the default domain; 
  *     that is, the domain associated with the current security context of the thread that performs the binding.
  * 
  * Because VBScript cannot read data from a type library, VBScript applications do not recognize the symbolic 
  *     constants as defined above. Use the numerical constants instead to set the appropriate flags in your VBScript 
  *     applications. To use the symbolic constants as a good programming practice, write explicit declarations of such 
  *     constants, as done here, in your Visual Basic Scripting edition application.
