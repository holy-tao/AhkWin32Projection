/**
 * Specifies the scope of a directory search.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * If you do not explicitly set the search scope, the default is <b>ADS_SCOPE_SUBTREE</b>.
  * 
  * Because VBScript cannot read data from a type library, VBScript applications do not recognize the symbolic constants as defined above. Use the numerical constants, instead, to set the appropriate flags in your VBScript applications. To use the symbolic constants as a good programming practice, create explicit declarations of such constants, as done here, in your VBScript applications.
