/**
 * Provides the local and remote names of the file to transfer.
 * @remarks
 * BITS supports the HTTP, HTTPS, and SMB protocols for <b>RemoteName</b>. For HTTP requirements, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Bits/http-requirements-for-bits-downloads">HTTP Requirements for BITS Downloads</a>.
  * 
  * <b>BITS 1.5 and earlier:  </b>The SMB protocol for <b>RemoteName</b> is not supported.
  * 
  * The following identifies whether BITS propagates a file's time stamps:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>For HTTP downloads, BITS propagates the file's modification time stamp and sets the file's creation time to the modification time.</li>
  * <li>For HTTP uploads, BITS does not propagate the file's time stamps.</li>
  * <li>For SMB downloads and uploads, BITS propagates the file's time stamps.</li>
  * </ul>
  * BITS does not support SMB paths to named pipes or devices.  To maintain the owner and ACL information for files downloaded using SMB, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/bits2_0/nf-bits2_0-ibackgroundcopyjob3-setfileaclflags">IBackgroundCopyJob3::SetFileACLFlags</a> method.
  * 
  * If the path and file name portion of the URL for an HTTP upload and upload-reply job contains Unicode characters not in common to the code page on both the client and server, the URL translation will fail on the server and the BITS job will be placed in the error state.
  * If the server portion of the URL contains Unicode characters, you must encode the server portion using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/handling-internationalized-domain-names--idns">Internationalized Domain Names</a> (IDN).
  * 
  * BITS does not limit the size of file you can download using HTTP. For upload limits, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Bits/bits-iis-extension-properties">BITSMaximumUploadSize</a> 
  * IIS extension property. 
  * 
  * <b>IIS 5.0:  </b>Downloads are limited to 4 GB.
  * 
  * <b>BITS 1.2 and earlier:  </b>For HTTP downloads, the maximum file size you can transfer is 4 GB; BITS cannot guarantee the successful transfer of files over 4 GB. If the  URL contains Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set, encode the Unicode string in UTF-8 before passing it as the remote file name to BITS. If you do not encode the string, the HTTP server may receive an incorrect URL and the job may enter the error state.
