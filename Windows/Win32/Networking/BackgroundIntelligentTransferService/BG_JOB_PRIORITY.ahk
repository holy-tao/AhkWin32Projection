/**
 * Defines constants that specify the priority level of a job.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * For a background job, the priority level determines when the job is processed relative to other jobs in the transfer queue. A higher-priority job preempts a lower-priority job. Jobs at the same priority level share transfer time, which prevents a large job from blocking the transfer queue. Lower-priority jobs don't receive transfer time until all higher-priority jobs are transferred, or are in an error state. 
  * 
  * Multiple foreground transfers can take place simultaneously. However, multiple files in the same job are transferred sequentially. For example, if you have 5 files that you would like to download concurrently, you may consider creating 5 foreground jobs, one for each transfer.
  * 
  * **BITS 1.5 and earlier:** BITS processes one job at a time. Foreground jobs have the highest priority and run before background jobs.
  * 
  * For more information, see [Best practices when using BITS](/windows/desktop/bits/best-practices-when-using-bits).
