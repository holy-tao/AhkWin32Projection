/**
 * The DHCP_CALLOUT_TABLE structure is used by Microsoft DHCP Server and third-party DLLs to send notification requests for DHCP Server events.
 * @remarks
 * It is not necessary to implement all hooks available from Microsoft DHCP Server. If notification for a particular event is not required, set the member to <b>NULL</b>. Remember, however, that the initially loaded third-party DLL is responsible for loading subsequent third-party DLLs, and that subsequent DLLs may require notification of events that otherwise would be <b>NULL</b>, resulting in a non-<b>NULL</b> setting for members used by chained third-party DLLs that would otherwise be unused.
