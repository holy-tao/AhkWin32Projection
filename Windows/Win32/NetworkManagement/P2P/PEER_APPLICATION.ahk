/**
 * The PEER_APPLICATION structure contains data describing a locally installed software application or component that can be registered and shared with trusted contacts within a peer collaboration network.
 * @remarks
 * An "application" is a set of software or software  features available on the peer's endpoint. Commonly, this refers to software packages that support peer networking activities, like games or other collaborative applications.
  * 
  * A peer application has a GUID representing a single specific application. When an application is registered for a peer, this GUID and the corresponding application can be made available to all trusted contacts of the peer, indicating the activities the peer can participate in. To deregister a peer application, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/p2p/nf-p2p-peercollabunregisterapplication">PeerCollabUnregisterApplication</a> with this GUID.
