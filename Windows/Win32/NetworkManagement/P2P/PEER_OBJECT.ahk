/**
 * The PEER_OBJECT structure contains application-specific run-time information that can be shared with trusted contacts within a peer collaboration network.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Peer objects are run-time data items associated with a particular application, such as a picture or avatar, a certificate, or a specific description. Each peer object must be smaller than 16K in size.
  * 
  * Trusted contacts watching this peer object will have a PEER_EVENT_OBJECT_CHANGED event raised on them signaling this peer object's change in status.
  * 
  * Peer object information is contained in the <b>data</b> member of this structure and  represented as a byte buffer with a maximum size of 16K.
  * 
  * The lifetime of a peer object is tied to the lifetime of the application that registered it.
