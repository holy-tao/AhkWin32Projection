/**
 * The SERVER_TRANSPORT_INFO_2 structure contains information about the specified transport protocol, including the transport name and address. This information level is valid only for the NetServerTransportAddEx function.
 * @remarks
 * The 
  * 				<b>SERVER_TRANSPORT_INFO_2</b> structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmserver/nf-lmserver-netservertransportaddex">NetServerTransportAddEx</a> function to bind the specified server to the transport protocol.
  * 
  * An example of the use of the SVTI2_REMAP_PIPE_NAMES value follows. Call the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmserver/nf-lmserver-netservertransportaddex">NetServerTransportAddEx</a> function to add a transport to the server, specifying the address of "MyServer" in the <b>svti2_transportaddress</b> member, and <b>SVTI2_REMAP_PIPE_NAMES</b> in the <b>svti2_flags</b> member. When a client attempts to open "Pipe" on "\\MyServer" the client will actually open $$MyServer\Pipe instead.
  * 
  * On Windows Server 2008  and Windows Vista with SP1, every name registered with the Windows remote file server (SRV) is designated as either a scoped name or a non-scoped name.  Every share that is added to the system will then either be attached to all of the non-scoped names, or to a single scoped name.  Applications that wish to use the scoping features are responsible for both registering the new name as a scoped endpoint and then creating the shares with an appropriate scope. In this way, legacy uses of the Network Management and Network Share Management functions are not affected in any way since they continue to register shares and names as non-scoped names.  
  * 
  * A scoped endpoint is created by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmserver/nf-lmserver-netservertransportaddex">NetServerTransportAddEx</a> function with the <i>level</i> parameter set to 2 and the <i>bufptr</i> parameter pointed to a <b>SERVER_TRANSPORT_INFO_2</b> structure with the <b>SVTI2_SCOPED_NAME</b> bit value set in <b>svti2_flags</b> member. A scoped endpoint is also created by calling the <b>NetServerTransportAddEx</b> function with the <i>level</i> parameter set to 3 and the <i>bufptr</i> parameter pointed to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmserver/ns-lmserver-server_transport_info_3">SERVER_TRANSPORT_INFO_3</a> structure with the <b>SVTI2_SCOPED_NAME</b> bit value set in <b>svti3_flags</b> member. 
  * 
  * When the <b>SVTI2_SCOPED_NAME</b> bit value is set for a transport, then shares can be added with a corresponding server name (the <b>shi503_servername</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmshare/ns-lmshare-share_info_503">SHARE_INFO_503</a> structure) in a scoped fashion using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netshareadd">NetShareAdd</a> function.  If there is no transport registered with the <b>SVTI2_SCOPED_NAME</b> bit value and the name provided in <b>shi503_servername</b> member, then the share add in a scoped fashion will not succeed.
  * 
  * 
  * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netshareadd">NetShareAdd</a> function is used to add a scoped share on a remote server specified in the <i>servername</i> parameter. The remote server specified in the <b>shi503_servername</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmshare/ns-lmshare-share_info_503">SHARE_INFO_503</a> passed in the <i>bufptr</i> parameter must have been bound to a transport protocol using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmserver/nf-lmserver-netservertransportaddex">NetServerTransportAddEx</a> function as a scoped endpoint. The <b>SVTI2_SCOPED_NAME</b> flag must have been specified in the <b>shi503_servername</b> member of the <b>SERVER_TRANSPORT_INFO_2</b> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmserver/ns-lmserver-server_transport_info_3">SERVER_TRANSPORT_INFO_3</a> structure for the transport protocol.  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netsharedelex">NetShareDelEx</a> function is used to delete a scoped share.  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netsharegetinfo">NetShareGetInfo</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/lmshare/nf-lmshare-netsharesetinfo">NetShareSetInfo</a> functions are to used to get and set information on a scoped share.  
  * 
  * Scoped endpoints are generally used by the cluster namespace.
