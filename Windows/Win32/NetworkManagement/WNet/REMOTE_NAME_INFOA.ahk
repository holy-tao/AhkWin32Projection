/**
 * The REMOTE_NAME_INFO structure contains information about the remote form of a universal name. It is used by the NPGetUniversalName function. (ANSI)
 * @remarks
 * > [!NOTE]
  * > The winnetwk.h header defines REMOTE_NAME_INFO as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
