/**
 * Contains statistics for either incoming or outgoing Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages on a particular computer.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Two 
  * <b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structures are required to hold all the ICMP statistics for a given computer. One 
  * <b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structure contains the statistics for incoming ICMP messages. The other contains the statistics for outgoing ICMP messages. For this reason, the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ipmib/ns-ipmib-mibicmpinfo">MIBICMPINFO</a> structure contains two 
  * <b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structures.
  * 
  * On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for WindowsÂ Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the <b>MIBICMPSTATS</b> structure is defined in the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file not in the <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Ipmib.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Ipmib.h</i> and <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header files should never be used directly.
