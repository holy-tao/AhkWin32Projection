/**
 * Defines the possible TCP offload states for a TCP connection.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The <b>TCP_CONNECTION_OFFLOAD_STATE</b> enumeration is defined on Windows Server 2003 and later. 
  * 
  * On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the <b>TCP_CONNECTION_OFFLOAD_STATE</b> enumeration  is defined in the <i>Tcpmib.h</i> header file not in the <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header file. Note that the <i>Tcpmib.h</i> header file is automatically included in <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> which is automatically included in the <i>Iphlpapi.h</i> header file. The  <i>Tcpmib.h</i> and <i>Iprtrmib.h</i> header files should never be used directly.
