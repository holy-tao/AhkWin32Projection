 * 
  * The <b>ONEX_AUTH_RESTART_REASON</b> enumerated type is used by the 802.1X module, a new wireless configuration component supported on WindowsÂ Vista and  later.  
  * 
  * The <b>ONEX_AUTH_RESTART_REASON</b> specifies the possible values for the reason that 802.1X authentication was restarted. A value from this enumeration is returned  when  the <b>NotificationSource</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms706902(v=vs.85)">WLAN_NOTIFICATION_DATA</a> structure is <b>WLAN_NOTIFICATION_SOURCE_ONEX</b>  and the <b>NotificationCode</b> member of the <b>WLAN_NOTIFICATION_DATA</b> structure for received notifications  is <b>OneXNotificationTypeAuthRestarted</b>. For this notification, the <b>pData</b> member of the <b>WLAN_NOTIFICATION_DATA</b> structure points to an  <b>ONEX_AUTH_RESTART_REASON</b> enumeration value that identifies the reason the authentication was restarted.
