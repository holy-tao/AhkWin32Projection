/**
 * Specifies the aspect ratio of a video image in a display window.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The AM_ARMODE_STRETCHED member causes a video stream to occupy the entire region of the display window when the window is resized, possibly stretching the video. The AM_ARMODE_LETTER_BOX member eliminates video stretching and distortions by keeping the aspect ratio consistent and painting the excess areas of the window a background color. The AM_ARMODE_CROP member also prevents stretching, by cropping the image if necessary.
