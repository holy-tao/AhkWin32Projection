/**
 * The DVD_ERROR enumeration value defines DVD error conditions.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * For the flags where <i>lParam2</i> contains two region codes, the regions are encoded as a set of bits, one bit per region, in reverse order. If a disc is allowed in a region, that bit is turned off. For example, for a Region 2 disc, the value is 11111101, with the second least significant bit turned off. A multi-region disc will have more than one bit turned off.
