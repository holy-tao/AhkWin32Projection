/**
 * Specifies how aggressively a pipeline component should drop samples.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * In drop mode, a component drops samples, more or less aggressively depending on the level of the drop mode. The specific algorithm used depends on the component. Mode 1 is the least aggressive mode, and mode 5 is the most aggressive. A component is not required to implement all five levels.
  * 
  * For example, suppose an encoded video stream has three B-frames between each pair of P-frames. A decoder might implement the following drop modes:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>
  * Mode 1: Drop one out of every three B frames.
  * 
  * </li>
  * <li>
  * Mode 2: Drop one out of every two B frames.
  * 
  * </li>
  * <li>
  * Mode 3: Drop all delta frames.
  * 
  * </li>
  * <li>
  * Modes 4 and 5: Unsupported.
  * 
  * </li>
  * </ul>
  * The enhanced video renderer (EVR) can drop video frames before sending them to the EVR mixer.
