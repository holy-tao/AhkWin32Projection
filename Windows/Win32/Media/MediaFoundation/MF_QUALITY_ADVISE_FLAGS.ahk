/**
 * Contains flags for the IMFQualityAdvise2::NotifyQualityEvent method.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * If the decoder sets the <b>MF_QUALITY_CANNOT_KEEP_UP</b> flag, the quality manager tries to reduce latency through the media source and the media sink. For example, it might request the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/medfound/enhanced-video-renderer">Enhanced Video Renderer</a> (EVR) to drop frames. During this period, the quality manager stops calling the decoder's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfqualityadvise2-notifyqualityevent">IMFQualityAdvise2::NotifyQualityEvent</a> method, until samples are no longer arriving late at the sink. At that point, the quality manager resumes calling <b>NotifyQualityEvent</b> on the decoder.
