 * 
  * If the DXVA-HD device is a software plug-in and the surface type is <b>DXVAHD_SURFACE_TYPE_VIDEO_INPUT_PRIVATE</b>, the device can support format types that are not supported natively by the graphics driver. For example, if the application requests an AYUV surface, the device could allocate a surface with a surface type of <b>D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8</b>.
