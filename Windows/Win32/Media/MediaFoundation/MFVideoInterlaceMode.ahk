/**
 * Specifies how a video stream is interlaced.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Scan lines in the lower field are 0.5 scan line lower than those in the upper field. In NTSC television, a frame consists of a lower field followed by an upper field. In PAL television, a frame consists of an upper field followed by a lower field.
  * 
  * The upper field is also called the even field, the top field, or field 2. The lower field is also called the odd field, the bottom field, or field 1.
  * 
  * If the interlace mode is MFVideoInterlace_FieldSingleUpper or MFVideoInterlace_FieldSingleLower, each sample contains a single field, so each buffer contains only half the number of field lines given in the media type.
