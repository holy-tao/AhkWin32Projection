/**
 * The WMP_WMDM_METADATA_ROUND_TRIP_DEVICE2PC structure is used by Windows Media Player to receive accelerated metadata synchronization information from portable devices that do not support MTP.
 * @remarks
 * The Windows Media Device Manager service provider should return as many object path names as will fit in the buffer size specified by the <i>pnOutBufferSize</i> parameter of the <b>DeviceIoControl</b> method. If the buffer is not large enough to contain the path name strings for all the changes, the device must set the <b>dwUnretrievedObjectCount</b> member to the appropriate (nonzero) value.
