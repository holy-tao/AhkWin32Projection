/**
 * Returns the voice's current state and cursor position data.
 * @remarks
 * For all encoded formats, including constant bit rate (CBR) formats such as adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM), <b>SamplesPlayed</b> is expressed in terms of decoded samples. For pulse code modulation (PCM) formats, <b>SamplesPlayed</b> is expressed in terms of either input or output samples. There is a one-to-one mapping from input to output for PCM formats.
  * 
  * 
  * 
  * If a client needs to get the correlated positions of several voices—that is, to know exactly which sample of a particular voice is playing when a specified sample of another voice is playing—it must make the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xaudio2/nf-xaudio2-ixaudio2sourcevoice-getstate">IXAudio2SourceVoice::GetState</a> calls in an XAudio2 engine callback. Doing this ensures that none of the voices advance while the calls are made.
