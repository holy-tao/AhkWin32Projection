/**
 * Base directivity pattern descriptor. Describes the type of directivity applied to a sound.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The scaling parameter is used to interpolate between directivity behavior and omnidirectional; it determines how much attenuation is applied to the source outside of the directivity pattern and controls how directional the source is.
  * 
  * For fully directional sources, while direct path signal outside the directivity pattern will be fully attenuated, any environmental reflections will still be audible.
