/**
 * The EndpointFormFactor enumeration defines constants that indicate the general physical attributes of an audio endpoint device.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The constants in this enumeration are the values that can be assigned to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/CoreAudio/pkey-audioendpoint-formfactor">PKEY_AudioEndpoint_FormFactor</a> property.
  * 
  * In digital pass-through mode, a digital interface transports blocks of non-PCM data through a connection without modifying them and without attempting to interpret their contents. For more information about digital pass-through mode, see the following documentation:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>The descriptions of the WAVE_FORMAT_WMA_SPDIF and WAVE_FORMAT_DOLBY_AC3_SPDIF wave-format tags in the Windows DDK documentation.</li>
  * <li>The white paper titled "Audio Driver Support for the WMA Pro-over-S/PDIF Format" at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/audio/default.mspx">Audio Device Technologies for Windows</a> website.</li>
  * </ul>
  * For information about obtaining a description of the audio jack or connector through which an audio endpoint device connects to an audio adapter, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/devicetopology/nf-devicetopology-iksjackdescription-getjackdescription">IKsJackDescription::GetJackDescription</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/devicetopology/nf-devicetopology-iksjackdescription2-getjackdescription2">IKsJackDescription2::GetJackDescription2</a>.
