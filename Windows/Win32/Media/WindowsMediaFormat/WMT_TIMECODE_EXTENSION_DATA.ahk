/**
 * The WMT_TIMECODE_EXTENSION_DATA structure contains information needed for a single SMPTE time code sample extension. One of these structures will be attached to every video frame that requires a SMPTE time code.
 * @remarks
 * One of the more common SMPTE user scenarios is assembling a bunch of clips from their source reels into a prospective edit, and preserving the source reel time code in the edit. The time code in this type of file consists of a set of disjointed SMPTE ranges, where each range corresponds to the linear time code from its source reel.
  * 
  * Because these ranges are not guaranteed to be in any sort of time-related order (in other words, the first range may occur earlier in time than the second range), the concept of a range is supported in the Windows Media Format SDK time code index and interfaces. SMPTE time code MUST increase in time over a given range. Minor discontinuities within the range (such as dropped frames, or drop-frame counting) need not be marked within the range.
  * 
  * Ranges are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing (in other words, 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦ ) with a WMV file. SMPTE time code values are guaranteed to be increasing within a given range in a WMV file, but not across ranges.
