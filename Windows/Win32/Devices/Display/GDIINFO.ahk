/**
 * The GDIINFO structure describes the graphics capabilities of a given device.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * GDI zero-initializes this structure before calling the driver-supplied <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvenablepdev">DrvEnablePDEV</a> function.
  * 
  * The <b>xStyleStep</b>, <b>yStyleStep</b>, and <b>denStyleStep</b> members define how a cosmetic line style should advance as it draws each pixel of a cosmetic line. The amount advanced along the style for each pixel is defined as a fraction that depends on whether the line is x-styled or y-styled. If the line is x-styled, the style advances by the fractional amount <b>dx/D</b> for each pixel moved in the x direction. Otherwise the style advances by <b>dy/D</b> for each pixel moved in the y direction.
  * 
  * The dots in the predefined line style PS_DOT are each one unit long. If the driver defines <b>xStyleStep</b> as one and <b>denStyleStep</b> as 5, then a dotted horizontal line consists of 5-pixels-on followed by 5-pixels-off, repeated.
  * 
  * Each of these three numbers must be less than 65536, even though the caps members are LONG values. These style steps are defined by the driver to ensure that the dots and dashes in a line are a pleasing size on the output device. The horizontal and vertical steps can be different to correct for nontrivial aspect ratios. For example, on an EGA display, whose pixels are 33 percent higher than they are wide, you can set:
  * 
  * 
  * ```
  * pdevcaps->xStyleStep   =  3;    // For an EGA
  * pdevcaps->yStyleStep   =  4;
  * pdevcaps->denStyleStep = 12;
  * ```
  * 
  * 
  * In this case, horizontal dotted lines are 4-pixels-on, 4-pixels-off, because the style advances by 3/12 or 1/4 for each pixel. Vertical dotted lines are 3-pixels-on/3-pixels-off.
  * 
  * Styled lines look better if both the x and y style steps divide evenly into the style denominator, as they do in the preceding example. This gives dashes and dots that are always the same length.
  * 
  * GDI needs this information so that its bitmap functions can emulate exactly what the device does on its own surface. Applications can access this information to determine exactly which pixels will be turned on for styled lines. Refer also to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/styled-cosmetic-lines">Styled Cosmetic Lines</a>.
  * 
  * The halftone-related members, <b>cxHTPat</b>, <b>cyHTPat</b>, <b>pHTPatA</b>, <b>pHTPatB</b>, and <b>pHTPatC</b>, can be used in an OEM Unidrv rendering plug-in to define a custom halftone pattern consisting of either one or three colors. These members are checked only if the <b>ulHTPatternSize</b> member is set to HT_PATSIZE_USER. In this case an OEM can use these members to define a custom halftone pattern, based on data stored in a resource file or generated by an OEM customization module. The <b>cxHTPat</b> and <b>cyHTPat</b> members define the size of each of the three two-dimensional halftone pattern arrays. The <b>pHTPatA</b>, <b>pHTPatB</b>, and <b>pHTPatC</b> members point to the respective pattern arrays for each color. If only one pattern array is used, <b>pHTPatA</b>, <b>pHTPatB</b>, and<b> pHTPatC</b> point to it.
  * 
  * Each byte threshold at a particular location in a halftone dither pattern determines whether the pixel at the corresponding output plane location will be on or off. A zero threshold value at a particular location in the pattern array indicates that the corresponding pixel location is ignored (is black). Threshold values from 1 to 255 provide the dither pattern with 255 levels of gray; if the pixel value in the output plane is greater than or equal to the threshold value for that location, the pixel is turned on. A pixel value less than its corresponding threshold value causes its pixel to be turned off in the output plane.

     * Specifies the way that color fragments are configured to form pixels on the display device. The color fragments on the display device can be arranged in RGB order, or in BGR order, completely independent of the RGB ordering in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/">frame buffer</a>. The color fragments can be configured in horizontal stripes in which all of the fragments in one row are the same color. Alternatively, the color fragments can be configured in vertical stripes, in which all fragments in one column are the same color. Vertical striping is preferred, since it effectively provides three separate fragments in a row for each pixel, thereby giving greater horizontal subpixel resolution.
