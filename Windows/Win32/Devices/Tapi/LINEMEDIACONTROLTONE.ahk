/**
 * The LINEMEDIACONTROLTONE structure describes a media action to be executed when a tone has been detected. It is used as an entry in an array. The lineSetMediaControl and TSPI_lineSetMediaControl functions use this structure.
 * @remarks
 * This structure may not be extended.
  * 
  * The 
  * <b>LINEMEDIACONTROLTONE</b> structure defines a tuple &lt;tone, media-control action&gt;. An array of these tuples is passed to the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linesetmediacontrol">lineSetMediaControl</a> function to set media control actions triggered by media type changes for a given call. When a change to a listed media type is detected, the corresponding action on the media stream is invoked.
  * 
  * A tone with all frequencies set to zero corresponds to silence. An application can thus monitor the call's information stream for silence.
