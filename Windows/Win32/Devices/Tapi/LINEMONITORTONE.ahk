/**
 * The LINEMONITORTONE structure describes a tone to be monitored. This is used as an entry in an array. The lineMonitorTones and TSPI_lineMonitorTones functions use this structure.
 * @remarks
 * This structure may not be extended.
  * 
  * The 
  * <b>LINEMONITORTONE</b> structure defines a tone for the purpose of detection. An array of tones is passed to the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linemonitortones">lineMonitorTones</a> function which monitors these tones and sends a LINE_MONITORTONE message to the application when a detection is made.
  * 
  * A tone with all frequencies set to zero corresponds to silence. An application can thus monitor the call's information stream for silence.
 * @see https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/tapi/ns-tapi-linemonitortone
