/**
 * The FAX_ROUTE structure contains information about a received fax document. The fax service passes the structure to a fax routing method in a call to the FaxRouteMethod function.
 * @remarks
 * A fax routing method can call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/faxroute/nc-faxroute-pfaxroutemodifyroutingdata">FaxRouteModifyRoutingData</a> callback function to change the routing information for a subsequent routing method. The function does this by modifying the <b>RoutingInfoData</b> member of the <b>FAX_ROUTE</b> structure that applies to the subsequent method. This allows a fax routing extension to retrieve user-defined routing data and to provide additional callback information to a different routing method. When the subsequent routing method executes, it processes the received fax transmission using the modified routing data. For more information, see <b>FaxRouteModifyRoutingData</b>.
  * 
  * The fax routing method can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-filetimetolocalfiletime">FileTimeToLocalFileTime</a> function, to convert from UTC to local time, and then use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/timezoneapi/nf-timezoneapi-filetimetosystemtime">FileTimeToSystemTime</a> function to convert the local time to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-systemtime">SYSTEMTIME</a> structure. SYSTEMTIME contains individual members for month, day, year, weekday, hour, minute, second, and millisecond. See MSDN for descriptions of these functions and this structure.
