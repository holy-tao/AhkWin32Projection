  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td><b>pSdpVersion</b></td>
  * <td>Pointer to ULONG version, which is changed whenever the binary format of SDP records change, affecting the format of the <b>pRecord</b> member. Set to <b>BTH_SDP_VERSION</b> for the client, and returned by the system.</td>
  * </tr>

  * <td>Handle to the SDP record; corresponds to SDP ServiceRecordHandle. Returned by the add record operations, and subsequently used to delete the record.</td>

  * 
  * The <b>pRecordHandle</b> member must point to data that is null for new service registration. For service deletion, <b>pRecordHandle</b> must point to a valid handle. The <b>pRecord</b> member must contain the entire SD service record, as described in the Bluetooth specification. For RFCOMM protocol entries, the port number is the same as the port returned by the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Bluetooth/bluetooth-and-getsockname">getsockname</a> function call.
  * 
  * Bluetooth implements a one-to-one correlation between SDP records and server sockets. As such, there is no need for the <b>SERVICE_MULTIPLE</b> flag.
