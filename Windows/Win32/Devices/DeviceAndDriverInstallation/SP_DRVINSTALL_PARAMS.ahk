/**
 * An SP_DRVINSTALL_PARAMS structure contains driver installation parameters associated with a particular driver information element.
 * @remarks
 * Starting with Windows 7, an installer or co-installer can set the DNF_REQUESTADDITIONALSOFTWARE flag to indicate that the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/difx-guidelines">driver package</a> requires additional software that may or not be installed in the computer.
  * 
  * After the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/difx-guidelines">driver package</a> for the device is installed, the Plug and Play (PnP) manager performs the following steps if the installer sets the DNF_REQUESTADDITIONALSOFTWARE flag:
  * 
  * <ol>
  * <li>
  * The PnP manager generates a Problem Report and Solution (PRS) error report with the type of <b>RequestAddtionalSoftware</b>. This report contains information about the specific hardware ID of the device and the system architecture of the computer. 
  * 
  * </li>
  * <li>
  * If there is a solution that is provided by the independent hardware vendor (IHV) for the device-specific software, the solution is downloaded to the computer.
  * 
  * <div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The download of the solution does not install the software itself.</div>
  * <div> </div>
  * </li>
  * <li>
  * If the device-specific software is not installed on the computer, the PnP manager presents the solution to the user and provides a link to download the software. The user can then choose to download and install this software by following the instructions presented in the solution.
  * 
  * </li>
  * </ol>
  * <div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The installer does not have to set the DNF_REQUESTADDITIONALSOFTWARE flag if the INF file for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/difxapi/driverpackagepreinstall">driver package</a> has set the <b>RequestAdditionalSoftware </b> flag in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/inf-controlflags-section">INF ControlFlags Section</a>.</div>
