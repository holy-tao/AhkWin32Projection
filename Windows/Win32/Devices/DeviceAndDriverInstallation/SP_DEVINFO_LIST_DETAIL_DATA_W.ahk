/**
 * An SP_DEVINFO_LIST_DETAIL_DATA structure contains information about a device information set, such as its associated setup class GUID (if it has an associated setup class). (Unicode)
 * @remarks
 * > [!NOTE]
  * > The setupapi.h header defines SP_DEVINFO_LIST_DETAIL_DATA as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
