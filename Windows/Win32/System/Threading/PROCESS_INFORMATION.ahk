/**
 * Contains information about a newly created process and its primary thread. It is used with the CreateProcess, CreateProcessAsUser, CreateProcessWithLogonW, or CreateProcessWithTokenW function.
 * @remarks
 * If the function succeeds, be sure to call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a> function to close the <b>hProcess</b> and <b>hThread</b> handles when you are finished with them. Otherwise, when the child process exits, the system cannot clean up the process structures for the child process because the parent process still has open handles to the child process. However, the system will close these handles when the parent process terminates, so the structures related to the child process object would be cleaned up at this point.
