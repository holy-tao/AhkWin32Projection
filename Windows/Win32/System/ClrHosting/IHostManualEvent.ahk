     * The

     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setcommmask">SetCommMask</a> and 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getcommmask">GetCommMask</a> functions.

When this happens, the system sets the <b>hEvent</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped">OVERLAPPED</a> structure to the not-signaled state before 
     * <b>WaitCommEvent</b> returns, and then it sets it to the signaled state when one of the specified events or an error occurs. The calling process can use one of the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Sync/wait-functions">wait functions</a> to determine the event object's state and then use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a> function to determine the results of the 
     * <b>WaitCommEvent</b> operation. 
     * <b>GetOverlappedResult</b> reports the success or failure of the operation, and the variable pointed to by the <i>lpEvtMask</i> parameter is set to indicate the event that occurred.

    /**
     * Resets the time-out period or other mechanism that TPM manufacturers implement to protect against dictionary attacks on TPM authorization values.
     * @remarks
     * This method calls the TPM\_ResetLockValue command on the TPM. The exact behavior of this method varies among TPM manufacturers. Documentation from the computer or TPM manufacturer may provide additional information on the implementation of the anti-dictionary attack mechanism.
     * 
     * In general, manufacturers can detect dictionary attacks by keeping track of failed authentications. If the number or frequency of failures become high enough, the TPM will lock out further commands for a certain time. Generally, the initial time-out period will be short, to allow a legitimate user a chance to correct the situation. If failures continue, the duration of each subsequent time-out period may increase rapidly.
