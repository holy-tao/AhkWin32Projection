/**
 * Contains preshutdown settings.
 * @remarks
 * Starting with the Windows Creatorâ€™s Update (build 15063) the default preshutdown time-out value is 10,000 milliseconds (10 seconds). In prior releases, the default preshutdown time-out value is 180,000 milliseconds (three minutes).
  * 
  * After the service control manager sends the SERVICE_CONTROL_PRESHUTDOWN notification to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winsvc/nc-winsvc-lphandler_function_ex">HandlerEx</a> function, it waits for one of the following to occur before proceeding with other shutdown actions: the specified time elapses or the service enters the SERVICE_STOPPED state. The service can continue to update its status for as long as it is in the SERVICE_STOP_PENDING state.
