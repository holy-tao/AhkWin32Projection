/**
 * Represents the action the service controller should take on each failure of a service. A service is considered failed when it terminates without reporting a status of SERVICE_STOPPED to the service controller. (Unicode)
 * @remarks
 * The service control manager counts the number of times each service has failed since the system booted. The count is reset to 0 if the service has not failed for <b>dwResetPeriod</b> seconds. When the service fails for the <i>N</i>th time, the service controller performs the action specified in element [<i>N</i>-1] of the <b>lpsaActions</b> array. If <i>N</i> is greater than <i>cActions</i>, the service controller repeats the last action in the array.

  * > [!NOTE]
  * > The winsvc.h header defines SERVICE_FAILURE_ACTIONS as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
