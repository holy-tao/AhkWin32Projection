/**
 * Contains information about a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) conversation. A DDE monitoring application can use this structure to obtain information about a conversation that has been established or has terminated.
 * @remarks
 * Because string handles are local to the process, the <b>hszSvc</b> and <b>hszTopic</b> members are global atoms. Similarly, conversation handles are local to the instance; therefore, the <b>hConvClient</b> and <b>hConvServer</b> members are window handles. 
  * 
  * The <b>hConvClient</b> and <b>hConvServer</b> members of the <b>MONCONVSTRUCT</b> structure do not hold the same value as would be seen by the applications engaged in the conversation. Instead, they hold a globally unique pair of values that identify the conversation.
