/**
 * Represents a version for an item or a change unit.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * A change that is made directly to a replica, such as a change that is made by a local application, will not have a version for the change in the synchronization metadata. A version that is created for such a change must contain the following elements:
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>The replica key of the local replica. This will typically be zero.</li>
  * <li>The current value of the tick count of the local replica.</li>
  * </ul>
  *
