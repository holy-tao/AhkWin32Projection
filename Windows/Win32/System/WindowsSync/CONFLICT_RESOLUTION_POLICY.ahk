  * The members of <b>CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_POLICY</b> are used by a synchronization application to specify the policy that the change applier uses to resolve concurrency conflicts that occur during synchronization. Concurrency conflicts occur when the same item or change unit is changed on two different replicas that are later synchronized.
