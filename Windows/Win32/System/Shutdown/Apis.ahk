     * Initiates a shutdown and optional restart of the specified computer. (ANSI)
     * @remarks
     * To shut down the local computer, the calling thread must have the <b>SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME</b> privilege. To shut down a remote computer, the calling thread must have the <b>SE_REMOTE_SHUTDOWN_NAME</b> privilege on the remote computer. By default, users can enable the <b>SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME</b> privilege on the computer they are logged onto, and administrators can enable the <b>SE_REMOTE_SHUTDOWN_NAME</b> privilege on remote computers. For more information, see 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecBP/running-with-special-privileges">Running with Special Privileges</a>.
     * 
     * Common reasons for failure include an invalid or inaccessible computer name or insufficient privilege. The error <b>ERROR_SHUTDOWN_IN_PROGRESS</b> is returned if a shutdown is already in progress on the specified computer. The error <b>ERROR_NOT_READY</b> can be returned if fast-user switching is enabled but no user is logged on.
     * 
     * A non-zero return value does not mean the logoff was or will be successful. The shutdown is an asynchronous process, and it can occur long  after the API call has returned, or not  at all. Even if the timeout value is zero,  the shutdown can still be aborted by applications, services or even the system. The non-zero return value indicates that the validation of the rights and parameters was  successful and that the system accepted the shutdown request.
     * 
     * When this function is called, the caller must specify whether or not applications with unsaved changes should be forcibly closed.  If the caller chooses not to force these applications closed, and an application with unsaved changes is running on the console session, the shutdown will remain in progress until the user logged into the console session aborts the shutdown, saves changes, closes the application, or forces the application to close.  During this period, the shutdown may not be aborted except by the console user, and another shutdown may not be initiated.
     * 
     * Note that calling this function with the value of the <i>bForceAppsClosed</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b> avoids this situation. Remember that doing this  may result in loss of data.
     * 
     * <b>Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  </b>If the computer is locked and the <i>bForceAppsClosed</i> parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the last error code is <b>ERROR_MACHINE_LOCKED</b>. If the system is not ready to handle the request, the last error code is <b>ERROR_NOT_READY</b>. The application should wait a short while and retry the call. For example, the system can be unready to initiate a shutdown, and return <b>ERROR_NOT_READY</b>,  if the shutdown request comes at the same time a user tries to log onto the system. In this case, the application should wait a short while and retry the call.
     * @param {Pointer<PSTR>} lpMachineName The network name of the computer to be shut down. If <i>lpMachineName</i> is <b>NULL</b> or an empty string, the function shuts down the local computer.
     * @param {Pointer<PSTR>} lpMessage The  message to be displayed in the shutdown dialog box. This parameter can be <b>NULL</b> if no message is required.

     *

     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-abortsystemshutdowna">AbortSystemShutdown</a> function.
     * 
     * If <i>dwTimeout</i> is not zero, 
     * <b>InitiateSystemShutdown</b> displays a dialog box on the specified computer. The dialog box displays the name of the user who called the function, displays the message specified by the <i>lpMessage</i> parameter, and prompts the user to log off. The dialog box beeps when it is created and remains on top of other windows in the system. The dialog box can be moved but not closed. A timer counts down the remaining time before a forced shutdown.
     * 
     * If <i>dwTimeout</i> is zero, the computer shuts down without displaying the dialog box, and the shutdown cannot be stopped by

The dialog box includes who requested the shutdown, the display message (see <i>lpMessage</i>), and how much time there is until the server is shut down.
     * @param {Integer} bForceAppsClosed If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, applications with unsaved changes are to be forcibly closed. Note that this can result in data loss.
     * 
     * If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the system displays a dialog box instructing the user to close the applications.
     * @param {Integer} bRebootAfterShutdown If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, the computer is to restart immediately after shutting down. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the system flushes all caches to disk  and  safely powers down the system.

     * Initiates a shutdown and optional restart of the specified computer, and optionally records the reason for the shutdown. (Unicode)
     * @remarks
     * To shut down the local computer, the calling thread must have the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege. To shut down a remote computer, the calling thread must have the SE_REMOTE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege on the remote computer. By default, users can enable the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege on the computer they are logged onto, and administrators can enable the SE_REMOTE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege on remote computers. For more information, see 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecBP/running-with-special-privileges">Running with Special Privileges</a>.
     * 
     * Common reasons for failure include an invalid or inaccessible computer name or insufficient privilege. The error ERROR_SHUTDOWN_IN_PROGRESS is returned if a shutdown is already in progress on the specified computer. The error ERROR_NOT_READY can be returned if fast-user switching is enabled but no user is logged on.
     * 
     * A non-zero return value does not mean the logoff was or will be successful. The shutdown is an asynchronous process, and it can occur long  after the API call has returned, or not  at all. Even if the timeout value is zero,  the shutdown can still be aborted by applications, services, or even the system. The non-zero return value indicates that the validation of the rights and parameters was  successful and that the system accepted the shutdown request.
     * 
     * When this function is called, the caller must specify whether or not applications with unsaved changes should be forcibly closed.  If the caller chooses not to force these applications to close and an application with unsaved changes is running on the console session, the shutdown will remain in progress until the user logged into the console session aborts the shutdown, saves changes, closes the application, or forces the application to close.  During this period the shutdown may not be aborted except by the console user, and another shutdown may not be initiated.
     * 
     * Note that calling this function with the value of the <i>bForceAppsClosed</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b> avoids this situation. Remember that doing this  may result in loss of data.
     * 
     * <b>Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  </b>If the computer is locked and the <i>bForceAppsClosed</i> parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the last error code is ERROR_MACHINE_LOCKED. If the system is not ready to handle the request, the last error code is ERROR_NOT_READY. The application should wait a short while and retry the call. For example, the system can be unready to initiate a shutdown, and return ERROR_NOT_READY,  if the shutdown request comes at the same time a user tries to log onto the system. In this case, the application should wait a short while and retry the call.

     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * If <i>dwTimeout</i> is not zero, 
     * <b>InitiateSystemShutdownEx</b> displays a dialog box on the specified computer. The dialog box displays the name of the user who called the function, displays the message specified by the <i>lpMessage</i> parameter, and prompts the user to log off. The dialog box beeps when it is created and remains on top of other windows in the system. The dialog box can be moved but not closed. A timer counts down the remaining time before shutdown.
     * 
     * If <i>dwTimeout</i> is zero, the computer shuts down without displaying the dialog box, and the shutdown cannot be stopped by

     * 
     * <b>Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP with SP1:  </b>If the computer to be shut down is a Terminal Services server, the system displays a dialog box to all local and remote users warning them that shutdown has been initiated. The dialog box includes who requested the shutdown, the display message (see <i>lpMessage</i>), and how much time there is until the server is shut down.
     * @param {Integer} bForceAppsClosed If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, applications with unsaved changes are to be forcibly closed. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the system displays a dialog box instructing the user to close the applications.
     * @param {Integer} bRebootAfterShutdown If this parameter is <b>TRUE</b>, the computer is to restart immediately after shutting down. If this parameter is <b>FALSE</b>, the system flushes all caches to disk  and  safely powers down the system.
     * @param {Integer} dwReason The reason for initiating the shutdown. This parameter must be one of the

     * 
     * 
     * If this parameter is zero, the default is an undefined shutdown that is logged as "No title for this reason could be found". By default, it is also an unplanned shutdown. Depending on how the system is configured, an unplanned shutdown triggers the creation of a file that contains the system state information, which can delay shutdown. Therefore, do not use zero for this parameter.

     * Logs off the interactive user, shuts down the system, or shuts down and restarts the system.
     * @remarks
     * The 
     * <b>ExitWindowsEx</b> function returns as soon as it has initiated the shutdown process. The shutdown or logoff then proceeds asynchronously. The function is designed to stop all processes in the caller's logon session. Therefore, if you are not the interactive user, the function can succeed without actually shutting down the computer. If you are not the interactive user, use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-initiatesystemshutdowna">InitiateSystemShutdown</a> or 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-initiatesystemshutdownexa">InitiateSystemShutdownEx</a> function.
     * 
     * A non-zero return value does not mean the logoff was or will be successful. The shutdown is an asynchronous process, and it can occur long  after the API call has returned, or not  at all. Even if the timeout value is zero,  the shutdown can still be aborted by applications, services, or even the system. The non-zero return value indicates that the validation of the rights and parameters was  successful and that the system accepted the shutdown request.
     * 
     * When this function is called, the caller must specify whether or not applications with unsaved changes should be forcibly closed.  If the caller chooses not to force these applications to close and an application with unsaved changes is running on the console session, the shutdown will remain in progress until the user logged into the console session aborts the shutdown, saves changes, closes the application, or forces the application to close.  During this period, the shutdown may not be aborted except by the console user, and another shutdown may not be initiated.
     * 
     * Calling this function with the value of the <i>uFlags</i> parameter set to EWX_FORCE avoids this situation. Remember that doing this  may result in loss of data.
     * 
     * To set a shutdown priority for an application relative to other applications in the system, use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setprocessshutdownparameters">SetProcessShutdownParameters</a> function.
     * 
     * During a shutdown or log-off operation, running applications are allowed a specific amount of time to respond to the shutdown request. If this time expires before all applications have stopped, the system displays a user interface that allows the user to forcibly shut down the system or to cancel the shutdown request. If the EWX_FORCE value is specified, the system forces running applications to stop when the time expires.
     * 
     * If the EWX_FORCEIFHUNG value is specified, the system forces hung applications to close and does not display the dialog box.
     * 
     * Console processes receive a separate notification message, CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT or CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT, as the situation warrants. A console process routes these messages to its 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/console/handlerroutine">HandlerRoutine</a> function. 
     * <b>ExitWindowsEx</b> sends these notification messages asynchronously; thus, an application cannot assume that the console notification messages have been handled when a call to 
     * <b>ExitWindowsEx</b> returns.
     * 
     * To shut down or restart the system, the calling process must use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-adjusttokenprivileges">AdjustTokenPrivileges</a> function to enable the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege. For more information, see 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecBP/running-with-special-privileges">Running with Special Privileges</a>.
     * @param {Integer} uFlags 
     * @param {Integer} dwReason The reason for initiating the shutdown. This parameter must be one of the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Shutdown/system-shutdown-reason-codes">system shutdown reason codes</a>.
     * 
     * If this parameter is zero, the SHTDN_REASON_FLAG_PLANNED reason code  will not be set and therefore the default action is an undefined shutdown that is logged as "No title for this reason could be found". By default, it is also an unplanned shutdown. Depending on how the system is configured, an unplanned shutdown triggers the creation of a file that contains the system state information, which can delay shutdown. Therefore, do not use zero for this parameter.
     * @returns {Integer} If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero. Because the function executes asynchronously, a nonzero return value indicates that the shutdown has been initiated. It does not indicate whether the shutdown will succeed. It is possible that the system, the user, or another application will abort the shutdown.
     * 
     * If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call
