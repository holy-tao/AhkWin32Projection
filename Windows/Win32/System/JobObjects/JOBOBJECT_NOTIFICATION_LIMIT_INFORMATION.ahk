/**
 * Contains information about notification limits for a job object. This structure is used by the SetInformationJobObject and QueryInformationJobObject functions with the JobObjectNotificationLimitInformation information class.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * When a notification limit is exceeded, the system sends a JOB_OBJECT_MSG_NOTIFICATION_LIMIT message to the I/O completion port associated with the job. Processes in the job continue to run and can continue to allocate memory or transmit read or write bytes beyond the specified limits. 
  * 
  * When the application monitoring the I/O completion port receives a JOB_OBJECT_MSG_NOTIFICATION_LIMIT message, it must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/jobapi2/nf-jobapi2-queryinformationjobobject">QueryInformationJobObject</a> with the <b>JobObjectLimitViolationInformation</b> information class. Limit violation information is received in a JOBOBJECT_LIMIT_VIOLATION_STRUCTURE that contains information about all notification limits that were exceeded at the time of the query. The system will not send another JOB_OBJECT_MSG_NOTIFICATION_LIMIT message until after   <b>QueryInformationJobObject</b> is called.  
  * 
  * CPU rate control limits for a job are established in a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winnt/ns-winnt-jobobject_cpu_rate_control_information">JOBOBJECT_CPU_RATE_CONTROL_INFORMATION</a> structure. The CPU rate control values in the <b>JOBOBJECT_NOTIFICATION_LIMIT_INFORMATION</b> structure specify how much the job can exceed its established CPU rate control limits before notification is sent.
