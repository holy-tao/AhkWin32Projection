/**
 * Contains basic and extended limit information for a job object.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * The system tracks the value of <b>PeakProcessMemoryUsed</b> and <b>PeakJobMemoryUsed</b> constantly. This allows you know the peak memory usage of each job. You can use this information to establish a memory limit using the <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY</b> or <b>JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_JOB_MEMORY</b> value.
  * 
  * Note that the job memory and process memory limits are very similar in operation, but they are independent. You could set a job-wide limit of 100 MB with a per-process limit of 10 MB. In this scenario, no single process could commit more than 10 MB, and the set of processes associated with a job could never exceed 100 MB.
  * 
  * To register for notifications  that a job has exceeded its peak memory limit while allowing processes to continue to commit memory, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/jobapi2/nf-jobapi2-setinformationjobobject">SetInformationJobObject</a> function with the <b>JobObjectNotificationLimitInformation</b> information class.
