/**
 * Specifies settings for a time zone and dynamic daylight saving time.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Dynamic daylight saving time provides support for time zones whose boundaries for daylight saving time change 
  *     from year to year. This feature enables easier updating of systems, especially for locales where the yearly DST 
  *     boundaries are known in advance. After the time zone has been updated, the current time zone setting is applied to 
  *     all time operations, even when the time in question occurred before the time zone changed. Therefore, it is best 
  *     to store UTC times and convert them to the current local time zone.
  * 
  * You can set the transition dates for the current year using the 
  *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/timezoneapi/nf-timezoneapi-setdynamictimezoneinformation">SetDynamicTimeZoneInformation</a> function. 
  *      To set future transition dates, you must add entries to the registry data. The settings for dynamic daylight time 
  *      are stored in the following registry key:
  * 
  * 
  * <pre xml:space="preserve"><b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>
  *    <b>SOFTWARE</b>
  *       <b>Microsoft</b>
  *          <b>Windows NT</b>
  *             <b>CurrentVersion</b>
  *                <b>Time Zones</b>
  *                   <i>time_zone_name</i>
  *                      <b>Dynamic DST</b></pre>
  * 
  * 
  * Each <b>Dynamic DST</b> key includes the following registry values.
  * 
  * <table>
  * <tr>
  * <th>Registry value</th>
  * <th>Type</th>
  * <th>Description</th>
  * </tr>
  * <tr>
  * <td><b>FirstEntry</b></td>

  * <td>The first year in the table.</td>

  * <td>The last year in the table.</td>

  * } REG_TZI_FORMAT;</code></pre>
