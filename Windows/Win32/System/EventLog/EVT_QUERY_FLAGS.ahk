It builds a new XPath beginning with the left most expression. The service validates the expression and if it is valid, the service adds the next expression to the XPath. The service repeats this process until it finds the expression that is failing. It then uses the valid expressions that it found beginning with the leftmost expression as the XPath query (which means that you may not get the events that you expected).
