/**
 * Contains information used in asynchronous (or overlapped) input and output (I/O).
 * @remarks
 * Any unused members of this structure should always be initialized to zero before the structure is used in a function call.  Otherwise, the function may fail and return <b>ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER</b>.
  * 
  * The <b>Offset</b> and <b>OffsetHigh</b> members together represent a 64-bit file position. It is a byte offset from the start of the file or file-like device, and it is specified by the user; the system will not modify these values. The calling process must set this member before passing the <b>OVERLAPPED</b> structure to functions that use an offset, such as the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> or 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a> (and related) functions.  
  * 
  * You can use the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-hasoverlappediocompleted">HasOverlappedIoCompleted</a> macro to check whether an asynchronous I/O operation has completed if <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult">GetOverlappedResult</a> is too cumbersome for your application. 
  * 
  * You can use the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/cancelio">CancelIo</a> function to cancel an asynchronous I/O operation.
  * 
  * A common mistake is to reuse an <b>OVERLAPPED</b> structure before the previous asynchronous operation has been completed. You should use a separate structure for each request. You should also create an event object for each thread that processes data. If you store the event handles in an array, you could easily wait for all events to be signaled using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitformultipleobjects">WaitForMultipleObjects</a> function.
