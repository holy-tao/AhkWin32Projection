/**
 * Describes a named property. Named properties enable clients to define custom properties in a larger namespace than the MAPI-defined property identifier range.
 * @remarks
 * The **MAPINAMEID** structure is used to describe named properties properties that have identifiers over 0x8000. A property set is an important part a named property. For example PS_PUBLIC_STRINGS or PS_ROUTING_ADDRTYPE are property sets defined by MAPI. 
  *   
  * Named properties enable clients to define custom properties in a larger namespace than is available in the MAPI-defined property identifier range. Property names cannot be used to obtain property values directly; they must first be mapped to property identifiers through the [IMAPIProp::GetIDsFromNames](imapiprop-getidsfromnames.md) method. For particular objects such as messages, MAPI reserves a range of property identifiers for custom properties. Therefore, for these objects, clients do not have to use named properties and can save the associated overhead. 
  *   
  * For more information about named properties, see [Named Properties](mapi-named-properties.md).
