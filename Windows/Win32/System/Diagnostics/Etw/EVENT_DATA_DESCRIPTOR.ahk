/**
 * The EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR structure defines a block of data that will be used in an ETW event.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Most event providers will not call **EventDataDescCreate** directly. Instead,
  * most event providers are implemented using an ETW framework that wraps the calls
  * to **EventRegister**, **EventWrite**, and **EventUnregister**. For example, you
  * might
  * [write an event manifest](/windows/win32/etw/writing-manifest-based-events) and
  * then use the [Message Compiler](/windows/win32/wes/message-compiler--mc-exe-) to
  * generate C/C++ code for the events, or you might use
  * [TraceLogging](/windows/win32/tracelogging/trace-logging-portal) to avoid the
  * need for a manifest.
  * 
  * To write an event that contains event data, you would create an array of
  * **EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR** structures (one element for each chunk of data) and
  * call the
  * [EventDataDescCreate](/windows/desktop/api/evntprov/nf-evntprov-eventdatadesccreate)
  * function to initialize each element with the data to be included in your event.
  * You would then pass this array to
  * [EventWrite](/windows/desktop/api/evntprov/nf-evntprov-eventwrite) to include
  * the data into the event. For an example, see
  * [Writing Manifest-based Events](/windows/desktop/ETW/writing-manifest-based-events).
  * 
  * The data written to the event will be the concatenation of the data chunks
  * referenced by the **EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR** structures passed to the
  * `EventWrite` function. This concatenation contains no padding and does not
  * retain any of the boundaries or size information from the original set of data
  * chunks.
  * 
  * The total size of an ETW event (the sum of the user-provided data, the
  * [EVENT_HEADER](/windows/desktop/api/evntcons/ns-evntcons-event_header), and any
  * [EVENT_HEADER_EXTENDED_DATA_ITEM](/windows/desktop/api/evntcons/ns-evntcons-event_header_extended_data_item)
  * that might be needed for the event) cannot exceed 64KB. Events larger than 64KB
  * will be dropped by the ETW runtime.
  * 
  * In addition, ETW events that cannot fit into a trace session buffer will also be
  * dropped. Each buffer has a 72-byte header, so the largest event that can fit
  * into a buffer is slightly smaller than the buffer's size. For example, a trace
  * session that uses 32KB buffers will not be able to accept any event larger than
  * 32,696 bytes (32,768-byte buffer minus the 72-byte header leaves 32,696 bytes
  * for events).
  *

 * @see https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api//evntprov/ns-evntprov-event_data_descriptor
