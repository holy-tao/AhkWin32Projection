     * The commit operation can overwrite existing data to reduce overall space requirements. This value is not recommended for typical usage because it is not as robust as the default value. In this case, it is possible for the commit operation to fail after the old data is overwritten, but before the new data is completely committed. Then, neither the old version nor the new version of the storage object will be intact.

 * <li>The low-memory save sequence will be used to safely save the storage object to a smaller file.</li>
 * <li>A previous commit returned <b>STG_E_MEDIUMFULL</b>, but overwriting the existing data would provide enough space to commit changes to the storage object.</li>
 * </ul>

Thus, even with this value specified, if the commit operation fails due to space requirements, the old data is safe. It is possible, however, for data loss to occur with the <b>STGC_OVERWRITE</b> value specified if the commit operation fails for any reason other than lack of disk space.

The performance increase comes at the expense of an increased risk of losing data if a problem occurs before the cache is saved and the data in the cache is lost.
