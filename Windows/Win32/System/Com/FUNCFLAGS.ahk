/**
 * Specifies function flags.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * FUNCFLAG_FHIDDEN means that the property should never be shown in object browsers, property browsers, and so on. This function is useful for removing items from an object model. Code can bind to the member, but the user will never know that the member exists.
  * 
  * FUNCFLAG_FNONBROWSABLE means that the property should not be displayed in a properties browser. It is used in circumstances in which an error would occur if the property were shown in a properties browser.
  * 
  * FUNCFLAG_FRESRICTED means that macro-oriented programmers should not be allowed to access this member. These members are usually treated as _FHIDDEN by tools such as Visual Basic, with the main difference being that code cannot bind to those members.
