 * Specifies the class of heap information to be set or retrieved.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * To retrieve information about a heap, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapqueryinformation">HeapQueryInformation</a> function. To enable features for a heap, use the 
  * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapsetinformation">HeapSetInformation</a> function.
  * 
  * <b>Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:  </b> A look-aside list is a fast memory allocation mechanism that contains only fixed-sized blocks. Look-aside lists are enabled by default for heaps that support them. Starting with Windows Vista, look-aside lists are not used and the LFH is enabled by default.
  * 
  * Look-aside lists are faster than general pool allocations that vary in size, because the system does not search for free memory that fits the allocation. In addition, access to look-aside lists is generally synchronized using fast atomic processor exchange instructions instead of mutexes or spinlocks. Look-aside lists can be created by the system or drivers. They can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool.
