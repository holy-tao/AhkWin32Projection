    /**
     * Creates a private heap object that can be used by the calling process. The function reserves space in the virtual address space of the process and allocates physical storage for a specified initial portion of this block.
     * @remarks
     * The 
     * <b>HeapCreate</b> function creates a private heap object from which the calling process can allocate memory blocks by using the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc">HeapAlloc</a> function. The initial size determines the number of committed pages that are allocated initially for the heap. The maximum size determines the total number of reserved pages. These pages create a block in the process's virtual address space into which the heap can grow. If requests by 
     * <b>HeapAlloc</b> exceed the current size of committed pages, additional pages are automatically committed from this reserved space, if the physical storage is available.
     * 
     * <b>Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  </b>By default, the newly created private heap is a standard heap. To enable the low-fragmentation heap, call the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapsetinformation">HeapSetInformation</a> function with a handle to the private heap.
     * 
     * The memory of a private heap object is accessible only to the process that created it. If a dynamic-link library (DLL) creates a private heap, the heap is created in the address space of the process that calls the DLL, and it is accessible only to that process.
     * 
     * The system uses memory from the private heap to store heap support structures, so not all of the specified heap size is available to the process. For example, if the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc">HeapAlloc</a> function requests 64 kilobytes (K) from a heap with a maximum size of 64K, the request may fail because of system overhead.
     * 
     * If <b>HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE</b> is not specified (the simple default), the heap serializes access within the calling process. Serialization ensures mutual exclusion when two or more threads attempt simultaneously to allocate or free blocks from the same heap. There is a small performance cost to serialization, but it must be used whenever multiple threads allocate and free memory from the same heap. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heaplock">HeapLock</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapunlock">HeapUnlock</a> functions can be used to block and permit access to a serialized heap.
     * 
     * Setting <b>HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE</b> eliminates mutual exclusion on the heap. Without serialization, two or more threads that use the same heap handle might attempt to allocate or free memory simultaneously, which may cause corruption in the heap. Therefore, <b>HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE</b> can safely be used only in the following situations:
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li>The process has only one thread.</li>
     * <li>The process has multiple threads, but only one thread calls the heap functions for a specific heap.</li>
     * <li>The process has multiple threads, and the application provides its own mechanism for mutual exclusion to a specific heap.</li>
     * </ul>
     * If the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heaplock">HeapLock</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapunlock">HeapUnlock</a> functions are called on a heap created with the <b>HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE</b> flag, the results are undefined.
     * 
     * To obtain a handle to the default heap for a process, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-getprocessheap">GetProcessHeap</a> function. To obtain handles to the default heap and private heaps that are active for the calling process, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-getprocessheaps">GetProcessHeaps</a> function.
     * @param {Integer} flOptions 
     * @param {Pointer} dwInitialSize The initial size of the heap, in bytes. This value determines the initial amount of memory that is committed for the heap. The value is rounded up to a multiple of the system page size. The value must be smaller than <i>dwMaximumSize</i>.
     * 
     * If this parameter is 0, the function commits one page. To determine the size of a page on the host computer, use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a> function.
     * @param {Pointer} dwMaximumSize The maximum size of the heap, in bytes. The 
     * <b>HeapCreate</b> function rounds <i>dwMaximumSize</i> up to a multiple of the system page size and then reserves a block of that size in the process's virtual address space for the heap. If allocation requests made by the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc">HeapAlloc</a> or 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heaprealloc">HeapReAlloc</a> functions exceed the size specified by <i>dwInitialSize</i>, the system commits additional pages of memory for the heap, up to the heap's maximum size. 
     * 
     * If <i>dwMaximumSize</i> is not zero, the heap size is fixed and cannot grow beyond the maximum size. Also, the largest memory block that can be allocated from the heap is slightly less than 512 KB for a 32-bit process and slightly less than 1,024 KB for a 64-bit process. Requests to allocate larger blocks fail, even if the maximum size of the heap is large enough to contain the block. 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * If <i>dwMaximumSize</i> is 0, the heap can grow in size. The heap's size is limited only by the available memory. Requests to allocate memory blocks larger than the limit for a fixed-size heap do not automatically fail; instead, the system calls the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc">VirtualAlloc</a> function to obtain the memory that is needed for large blocks. Applications that need to allocate large memory blocks should set <i>dwMaximumSize</i> to 0.

     * Reserves, commits, or changes the state of a region of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process. (VirtualAlloc)
     * @remarks
     * Each page has an associated [page state](/windows/win32/Memory/page-state). The **VirtualAlloc** function can perform the following operations:
     * 
     * - Commit a region of reserved pages
     * - Reserve a region of free pages
     * - Simultaneously reserve and commit a region of free pages
     * 
     * **VirtualAlloc** cannot reserve a reserved page. It can commit a page that is already committed. This means you can commit a range of pages, regardless of whether they have already been committed, and the function will not fail.
     * 
     * You can use **VirtualAlloc** to reserve a block of pages and then make additional calls to **VirtualAlloc** to commit individual pages from the reserved block. This enables a process to reserve a range of its virtual address space without consuming physical storage until it is needed.
     * 
     * If the _lpAddress_ parameter is not **NULL**, the function uses the _lpAddress_ and _dwSize_ parameters to compute the region of pages to be allocated. The current state of the entire range of pages must be compatible with the type of allocation specified by the _flAllocationType_ parameter. Otherwise, the function fails and none of the pages are allocated. This compatibility requirement does not preclude committing an already committed page, as mentioned previously.
     * 
     * To execute dynamically generated code, use **VirtualAlloc** to allocate memory and the [VirtualProtect](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect) function to grant **PAGE_EXECUTE** access.
     * 
     * The **VirtualAlloc** function can be used to reserve an [Address Windowing Extensions](/windows/win32/Memory/address-windowing-extensions) (AWE) region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. This region of memory can then be used to map physical pages into and out of virtual memory as required by the application. The **MEM_PHYSICAL** and **MEM_RESERVE** values must be set in the _AllocationType_ parameter. The **MEM_COMMIT** value must not be set. The page protection must be set to **PAGE_READWRITE**.
     * 
     * The [VirtualFree](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree) function can decommit a committed page, releasing the page's storage, or it can simultaneously decommit and release a committed page. It can also release a reserved page, making it a free page.
     * 
     * When creating a region that will be executable, the calling program bears responsibility for ensuring cache coherency via an appropriate call to [FlushInstructionCache](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache) once the code has been set in place. Otherwise attempts to execute code out of the newly executable region may produce unpredictable results.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} lpAddress The starting address of the region to allocate. If the memory is being reserved, the specified address is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the allocation granularity. If the memory is already reserved and is being committed, the address is rounded down to the next page boundary. To determine the size of a page and the allocation granularity on the host computer, use the [GetSystemInfo](/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo) function. If this parameter is **NULL**, the system determines where to allocate the region.
     * 
     * If this address is within an enclave that you have not initialized by calling [InitializeEnclave](/windows/win32/api/enclaveapi/nf-enclaveapi-initializeenclave), **VirtualAlloc** allocates a page of zeros for the enclave at that address. The page must be previously uncommitted, and will not be measured with the EEXTEND instruction of the Intel Software Guard Extensions programming model.
     * 
     * If the address is within an enclave that you initialized, then the allocation operation fails with the **ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS** error. That is true for enclaves that do not support dynamic memory management (i.e. SGX1). SGX2 enclaves will permit allocation, and the page must be accepted by the enclave after it has been allocated.
     * @param {Pointer} dwSize The size of the region, in bytes. If the _lpAddress_ parameter is **NULL**, this value is rounded up to the next page boundary. Otherwise, the allocated pages include all pages containing one or more bytes in the range from _lpAddress_ to _lpAddress_+_dwSize_. This means that a 2-byte range straddling a page boundary causes both pages to be included in the allocated region.
     * @param {Integer} flAllocationType 
     * @param {Integer} flProtect The memory protection for the region of pages to be allocated. If the pages are being committed, you can specify any one of the [memory protection constants](/windows/win32/Memory/memory-protection-constants).

Otherwise attempts to execute code out of the newly executable region may produce unpredictable results.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} lpAddress The address of the starting page of the region of pages whose access protection attributes are to be changed.

     * Each page of memory in a process virtual address space has a [Page State](/windows/win32/Memory/page-state). The **VirtualFree** function can decommit a range of pages that are in different states, some committed and some uncommitted. This means that you can decommit a range of pages without first determining the current commitment state of each page. Decommitting a page releases its physical storage, either in memory or in the paging file on disk.
     * 
     * If a page is decommitted but not released, its state changes to reserved. Subsequently, you can call [VirtualAlloc](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc) to commit it, or **VirtualFree** to release it. Attempts to read from or write to a reserved page results in an access violation exception.
     * 
     * The **VirtualFree** function can release a range of pages that are in different states, some reserved and some committed. This means that you can release a range of pages without first determining the current commitment state of each page. The entire range of pages originally reserved by the [VirtualAlloc](nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc.md) function must be released at the same time.
     * 
     * If a page is released, its state changes to free, and it is available for subsequent allocation operations. After memory is released or decommited, you can never refer to the memory again. Any information that may have been in that memory is gone forever. Attempting to read from or write to a free page results in an access violation exception. If you need to keep information, do not decommit or free memory that contains the information.
     * 
     * The **VirtualFree** function can be used on an AWE region of memory, and it invalidates any physical page mappings in the region when freeing the address space. However, the physical page is not deleted, and the application can use them. The application must explicitly call [FreeUserPhysicalPages](nf-memoryapi-freeuserphysicalpages.md) to free the physical pages. When the process is terminated, all resources are cleaned up automatically.
     * 
     * **Windows 10, version 1709 and later and Windows 11:** To delete the enclave when you finish using it, call [DeleteEnclave](../enclaveapi/nf-enclaveapi-deleteenclave.md). You cannot delete a VBS enclave by calling the **VirtualFree** or [VirtualFreeEx](nf-memoryapi-virtualfreeex.md) function. You can still delete an SGX enclave by calling **VirtualFree** or **VirtualFreeEx**.
     * 
     * **Windows 10, version 1507, Windows 10, version 1511, Windows 10, version 1607 and Windows 10, version 1703:** To delete the enclave when you finish using it, call the **VirtualFree** or [VirtualFreeEx](nf-memoryapi-virtualfreeex.md) function and specify the following values:

     * - The base address of the enclave for the _lpAddress_ parameter.
     * - 0 for the _dwSize_ parameter.
     * - **MEM_RELEASE** for the _dwFreeType_ parameter.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} lpAddress A pointer to the base address of the region of pages to be freed.

     * If the _dwFreeType_ parameter is **MEM_RELEASE**, this parameter must be the base address returned by the [VirtualAlloc](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc) function when the region of pages is reserved.
     * @param {Pointer} dwSize The size of the region of memory to be freed, in bytes.
     * 
     * If the _dwFreeType_ parameter is **MEM_RELEASE**, this parameter must be 0 (zero). The function frees the entire region that is reserved in the initial allocation call to [VirtualAlloc](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc).
     * 
     * If the _dwFreeType_ parameter is **MEM_DECOMMIT**, the function decommits all memory pages that contain one or more bytes in the range from the _lpAddress_ parameter to `(lpAddress+dwSize)`. This means, for example, that a 2-byte region of memory that straddles a page boundary causes both pages to be decommitted. If _lpAddress_ is the base address returned by [VirtualAlloc](/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc) and _dwSize_ is 0 (zero), the function decommits the entire region that is allocated by **VirtualAlloc**.

     * Reserves, commits, or changes the state of a region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. The function initializes the memory it allocates to zero. (VirtualAllocEx)
     * @remarks
     * Each page has an associated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/page-state">page state</a>. The 
     *      <b>VirtualAllocEx</b> function can perform the following 
     *      operations:
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li>Commit a region of reserved pages</li>
     * <li>Reserve a region of free pages</li>
     * <li>Simultaneously reserve and commit a region of free pages</li>
     * </ul>
     * <b>VirtualAllocEx</b> cannot reserve a reserved page. It 
     *     can commit a page that is already committed. This means you can commit a range of pages, regardless of whether 
     *     they have already been committed, and the function will not fail.
     * 
     * You can use <b>VirtualAllocEx</b> to reserve a block of 
     *     pages and then make additional calls to <b>VirtualAllocEx</b> 
     *     to commit individual pages from the reserved block. This enables a process to reserve a range of its virtual 
     *     address space without consuming physical storage until it is needed.
     * 
     * If the <i>lpAddress</i> parameter is not <b>NULL</b>, the function uses 
     *     the <i>lpAddress</i> and <i>dwSize</i> parameters to compute the region of 
     *     pages to be allocated. The current state of the entire range of pages must be compatible with the type of 
     *     allocation specified by the <i>flAllocationType</i> parameter. Otherwise, the function fails 
     *     and none of the pages is allocated. This compatibility requirement does not preclude committing an already 
     *     committed page; see the preceding list.
     * 
     * To execute dynamically generated code, use 
     *     <b>VirtualAllocEx</b> to allocate memory and the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotectex">VirtualProtectEx</a> function to grant 
     *     <b>PAGE_EXECUTE</b> access.
     * 
     * The <b>VirtualAllocEx</b> function can be used to reserve 
     *     an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/address-windowing-extensions">Address Windowing Extensions</a> 
     *     (AWE) region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. This region of memory can then be 
     *     used to map physical pages into and out of virtual memory as required by the application. The 
     *     <b>MEM_PHYSICAL</b> and <b>MEM_RESERVE</b> values must be set in the 
     *     <i>AllocationType</i> parameter. The <b>MEM_COMMIT</b> value must not be 
     *     set. The page protection must be set to <b>PAGE_READWRITE</b>.
     * 
     * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfreeex">VirtualFreeEx</a> function can decommit a committed 
     *     page, releasing the page's storage, or it can simultaneously decommit and release a committed page. It can also 
     *     release a reserved page, making it a free page.
     * 
     * When creating a region that will be executable, the calling program bears responsibility for ensuring cache 
     *     coherency via an appropriate call to 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache">FlushInstructionCache</a> once the code has been set 
     *     in place. Otherwise attempts to execute code out of the newly executable region may produce unpredictable 
     *     results.
     * @param {Pointer<HANDLE>} hProcess The handle to a process. The function allocates memory within the virtual address space of this process.
     * 
     * The handle must have the <b>PROCESS_VM_OPERATION</b> access right. For more information, 
     *        see 
     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ProcThread/process-security-and-access-rights">Process Security and Access Rights</a>.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} lpAddress The pointer that specifies a desired starting address for the region of pages that you want to allocate.
     * 
     * If you are reserving memory, the function rounds this address down to the nearest multiple of the allocation 
     *        granularity.
     * 
     * If you are committing memory that is already reserved, the function rounds this address down to the nearest 
     *        page boundary. To determine the size of a page and the allocation granularity on the host computer, use the 
     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a> function.
     * 
     * If <i>lpAddress</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function determines where to 
     *        allocate the region.
     * 
     * If this address is within an enclave that you have not initialized by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/enclaveapi/nf-enclaveapi-initializeenclave">InitializeEnclave</a>, <b>VirtualAllocEx</b> allocates a page of zeros for the enclave at that address. The page must be previously uncommitted, and will not be measured with the EEXTEND instruction of the Intel Software Guard Extensions programming model. 
     * 
     * If the address in within an enclave that you initialized, then the allocation operation fails with the <b>ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS</b> error. That is true for enclaves that do not support dynamic memory management (i.e. SGX1).  SGX2 enclaves will permit allocation, and the page must be accepted by the enclave after it has been allocated.
     * @param {Pointer} dwSize The size of the region of memory to allocate, in bytes.
     * 
     * If <i>lpAddress</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function rounds 
     *        <i>dwSize</i> up to the next page boundary.
     * 
     * If <i>lpAddress</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, the function allocates all 
     *        pages that contain one or more bytes in the range from <i>lpAddress</i> to 
     *        <i>lpAddress</i>+<i>dwSize</i>. This means, for example, that a 2-byte 
     *        range that straddles a page boundary causes the function to allocate both pages.
     * @param {Integer} flAllocationType 
     * @param {Integer} flProtect The memory protection for the region of pages to be allocated. If the pages are being committed, you can specify any one of the [memory protection constants](/windows/win32/Memory/memory-protection-constants).

     * The access protection value can be set only on committed pages. If the state of any page in the specified region is not committed, the function fails and returns without modifying the access protection of any pages in the specified region.
     * 
     * The **PAGE_GUARD** protection modifier establishes guard pages. Guard pages act as one-shot access alarms. For more information, see [Creating Guard Pages](/windows/win32/Memory/creating-guard-pages).
     * 
     * It is best to avoid using **VirtualProtectEx** to change page protections on memory blocks allocated by [GlobalAlloc](/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-globalalloc), [HeapAlloc](/windows/win32/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc), or [LocalAlloc](/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-localalloc), because multiple memory blocks can exist on a single page. The heap manager assumes that all pages in the heap grant at least read and write access.
     * 
     * When protecting a region that will be executable, the calling program bears responsibility for ensuring cache coherency via an appropriate call to [FlushInstructionCache](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache) once the code has been set in place. Otherwise attempts to execute code out of the newly executable region may produce unpredictable results.

     * @param {Pointer<Void>} lpAddress A pointer to the base address of the region of pages whose access protection attributes are to be changed.

The pages cannot span adjacent reserved regions that were allocated by separate calls to **VirtualAlloc** or **VirtualAllocEx** using **MEM_RESERVE**.
     * @param {Pointer} dwSize The size of the region whose access protection attributes are changed, in bytes. The region of affected pages includes all pages containing one or more bytes in the range from the _lpAddress_ parameter to `(lpAddress+dwSize)`. This means that a 2-byte range straddling a page boundary causes the protection attributes of both pages to be changed.
     * @param {Integer} flNewProtect The memory protection option. This parameter can be one of the [memory protection constants](/windows/win32/Memory/memory-protection-constants).
     *

     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-mapviewoffileex">MapViewOfFileEx</a> functions map a view of a file into a 
     *     process address space.
     * 
     * With one important exception, file views derived from any file mapping object that is backed by the same file 
     *     are coherent or identical at a specific time. Coherency is guaranteed for views within a process and for views 
     *     that are mapped by different processes.
     * 
     * The exception is related to remote files. Although 
     *     <b>CreateFileMapping</b> works with remote files, it does 
     *     not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable, and both change the same page, 
     *     each computer only sees its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, it is not merged.
     * 
     * A mapped file and a file that is accessed by using the input and output (I/O) functions 
     *     (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> and 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a>) are not necessarily coherent.
     * 
     * Mapped views of a file mapping object maintain internal references to the object, and a file mapping object 
     *     does not close until all references to it are released. Therefore, to fully close a file mapping object, an 
     *     application must unmap all mapped views of the file mapping object by calling 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> and  close the file mapping object 
     *     handle by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a>. These functions can be 
     *     called in any order.
     * 
     * When modifying a file through a mapped view, the last modification timestamp may not be updated automatically. 
     *     If required, the caller should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime">SetFileTime</a> to set the 
     *     timestamp.
     * 
     * Creating a file mapping object in the global namespace from a session other than session zero requires the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/authorization-constants">SeCreateGlobalPrivilege</a> privilege. 
     *      Note that this privilege check is limited to the creation of file mapping objects and does not apply to opening 
     *      existing ones. For example, if a service or the system creates a file mapping object in the global namespace, any 
     *      process running in any session can access that file mapping object provided that the caller has the required 
     *      access rights.

     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/file-security-and-access-rights">File Security and Access Rights</a>.
     * 
     * If <i>hFile</i> is <b>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</b>, the calling process 
     *        must also specify a size for the file mapping object in the <i>dwMaximumSizeHigh</i> and

     *        <b>CreateFileMapping</b> creates a file mapping object 
     *        of a specified size  that is backed by the system paging file instead of by a file in the file system.
     * @param {Pointer<SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES>} lpFileMappingAttributes A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa379560(v=vs.85)">SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES</a>

     *       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/file-mapping-security-and-access-rights">File Mapping Security and Access Rights</a>.
     * @param {Integer} flProtect Specifies the page protection of the file mapping object. All mapped views of the object must be compatible 
     *        with this protection.
     * @param {Integer} dwMaximumSizeHigh The high-order <b>DWORD</b> of the maximum size of the file mapping object.
     * @param {Integer} dwMaximumSizeLow The low-order <b>DWORD</b> of the maximum size of the file mapping object.
     * 
     * If this parameter and <i>dwMaximumSizeHigh</i> are 0 (zero), the maximum size of the file 
     *        mapping object is equal to the current size of the file that  <i>hFile</i> identifies.

     * 
     * If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, the file mapping object is created without a name.
     * 
     * If <i>lpName</i> matches the name of an existing event, semaphore, mutex, waitable timer, or

     * 
     * The name can have a "Global\" or "Local\" prefix to explicitly create the 
     *        object in the global or session namespace. The remainder of the name can contain any character except the 
     *        backslash character (\\). Creating a file mapping object in the global namespace from a session other than

     * Maps a view of a file mapping into the address space of a calling process.
     * @remarks
     * Mapping a file makes the specified portion of a file visible in the address space of the calling process.
     * 
     * For files that are larger than the address space, you can only map a small portion of the file data at one 
     *     time. When the first view is complete, you can unmap it and map a new view.
     * 
     * To obtain the size of a view, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualquery">VirtualQuery</a> 
     *     function.
     * 
     * Multiple views of a file (or a file mapping object and its mapped file) are <i>coherent</i> 
     *     if they contain identical data at a specified time. This occurs if the file views are derived from any file 
     *     mapping object that is backed by the same file. A process can duplicate a file mapping object handle into another 
     *     process by using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle">DuplicateHandle</a> function, or 
     *     another process can open a file mapping object by name by using the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-openfilemappinga">OpenFileMapping</a> function.
     * 
     * With one important exception, file views derived from any file mapping object that is backed by the same file 
     *     are coherent or identical at a specific time. Coherency is guaranteed for views within a process and for views 
     *     that are mapped by different processes.
     * 
     * The exception is related to remote files. Although 
     *     <b>MapViewOfFile</b> works with remote files, it does not keep 
     *     them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable, and both change the same page, each 
     *     computer only sees its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, it is not merged.
     * 
     * A mapped view of a file is not guaranteed to be coherent with a file that is being accessed by the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> or

     * Do not store pointers in the memory mapped file; store offsets from the base of the file mapping so that the 
     *     mapping can be used at any address.
     * 
     * To guard against <b>EXCEPTION_IN_PAGE_ERROR</b> 
     *     exceptions, use structured exception handling to protect any code that writes to or reads from a memory mapped 
     *     view of a file other than the page file. For more information, see 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/reading-and-writing-from-a-file-view">Reading and Writing From a File View</a>.
     * 
     * When modifying a file through a mapped view, the last modification timestamp may not be updated automatically.

     *      timestamp.
     * 
     * If a file mapping object is backed by the paging file 
     *      (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createfilemappinga">CreateFileMapping</a> is called with the 
     *      <i>hFile</i> parameter set to <b>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</b>), the paging file 
     *      must be large enough to hold the entire mapping. If it is not, 
     *      <b>MapViewOfFile</b> fails. The initial contents of the pages 
     *      in a file mapping object backed by the paging file are 0 (zero).
     * 
     * When a file mapping object that is backed by the paging file is created, the caller can  specify whether 
     *      <b>MapViewOfFile</b> should reserve and commit pages at the 
     *      same time (<b>SEC_COMMIT</b>) or  simply reserve pages 
     *      (<b>SEC_RESERVE</b>). Mapping the file makes the entire mapped virtual address range 
     *      unavailable to other allocations in the process. After a page from the reserved range is committed, it cannot be 
     *      freed or decommitted by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree">VirtualFree</a>. Reserved and 
     *      committed pages are released when the view is unmapped and the file mapping object is closed. For details, see

     * With one important exception, file views derived from any file mapping object that is backed by the same file

     * The exception is related to remote files. Although 
     *     <b>MapViewOfFileEx</b> works with remote files, it does not 
     *     keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable, and both change the same page, each 
     *     computer only sees its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, it is not merged.
     * 
     * A mapped view of a file is not guaranteed to be coherent with a file being accessed by the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> or 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a> function.
     * 
     * To guard against <b>EXCEPTION_IN_PAGE_ERROR</b> exceptions, use structured exception 
     *     handling to protect any code that writes to or reads from a memory mapped view of a file other than the page file.

This means that you can decommit a range of pages without first determining the current commitment state of each page. Decommitting a page releases its physical storage, either in memory or in the paging file on disk.
     * 
     * If a page is decommitted but not released, its state changes to reserved. Subsequently, you can  call 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex">VirtualAllocEx</a> to commit it, or

     * 
     * The **VirtualFreeEx** function can release a range of pages that are in different states, some reserved and some committed. This means that you can release a range of pages without first determining the current commitment state of each page. The entire range of pages originally reserved by [VirtualAllocEx](nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex.md) must be released at the same time.
     * 
     * If a page is released, its state changes to free, and it is available for subsequent allocation operations. After memory is released or decommitted, you can never refer to the memory again. Any information that may have been in that memory is gone forever. Attempts to read from or write to a free page results in an access violation exception. If you need to keep information, do not decommit or free memory that  contains the information.
     * 
     * The **VirtualFreeEx** function can be used on an AWE region of memory and it invalidates any physical page mappings in the region when freeing the address space. However, the physical pages are not deleted, and the application can use them. The application must explicitly call [FreeUserPhysicalPages](nf-memoryapi-freeuserphysicalpages.md) to free the physical pages. When the  process is terminated, all resources are automatically cleaned up.

     * 
     *

     * Unmapping a mapped view of a file invalidates the range occupied by the view in the address space of the process and makes the range available for other allocations. It removes the working set entry for each unmapped virtual page that was part of the working set of the process and reduces the working set size of the process. It also decrements the share count of the corresponding physical page.
     * 
     * Modified pages in the unmapped view are not written to disk until their share count reaches zero, or in other words, until they are unmapped or trimmed from the working sets of all processes that share the pages. Even then, the modified pages are written "lazily" to disk; that is, modifications may be cached in memory and written to disk at a later time. To minimize the risk of data loss in the event of a power failure or a system crash, applications should explicitly flush modified pages using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-flushviewoffile">FlushViewOfFile</a> function.

    /**
     * Sets the minimum and maximum working set sizes for the specified process. (SetProcessWorkingSetSizeEx)
     * @remarks
     * The working set of a process is the set of memory pages in the virtual address space of the process that are currently resident in physical memory. These pages are available for an application to use without triggering a page fault. For more information about page faults, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/working-set">Working Set</a>. The minimum and maximum working set sizes affect the virtual memory paging behavior of a process.
     * 
     * The working set of the specified process can be emptied by specifying the value (<b>SIZE_T</b>)–1 for both the minimum and maximum working set sizes. This removes as many pages as possible from the working set. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/psapi/nf-psapi-emptyworkingset">EmptyWorkingSet</a> function can also be used for this purpose.
     * 
     * If the values of either <i>dwMinimumWorkingSetSize</i> or <i>dwMaximumWorkingSetSize</i> are greater than the process' current working set sizes, the specified process must have the <b>SE_INC_WORKING_SET_NAME</b> privilege. All users generally have this privilege. For more information about security privileges, see 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/privileges">Privileges</a>.
     * 
     * <b>Windows Server 2003:  </b>The specified process must have the <b>SE_INC_BASE_PRIORITY_NAME</b> privilege. Users in the Administrators and Power Users groups generally have this privilege.
     * 
     * The operating system allocates working set sizes on a first-come, first-served basis. For example, if an application successfully sets 40 megabytes as its minimum working set size on a 64-megabyte system, and a second application requests a 40-megabyte working set size, the operating system denies the second application's request.
     * 
     * By default, using the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-setprocessworkingsetsize">SetProcessWorkingSetSize</a> function to set an application's minimum and maximum working set sizes does not guarantee that the requested memory will be reserved, or that it will remain resident at all times. When an application is idle, or a low-memory situation causes a demand for memory, the operating system can reduce the application's working set below its minimum working set limit. If memory is abundant, the system might allow an application to exceed its maximum working set limit. The <b>QUOTA_LIMITS_HARDWS_MIN_ENABLE</b> and <b>QUOTA_LIMITS_HARDWS_MAX_ENABLE</b> flags enable you to ensure that limits are enforced.
     * 
     * When you increase the working set size of an application, you are taking away physical memory from the rest of the system. This can degrade the performance of other applications and the system as a whole. It can also lead to failures of operations that require physical memory to be present (for example, creating processes, threads, and kernel pool). Thus, you must use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-setprocessworkingsetsize">SetProcessWorkingSetSize</a> function carefully. You must always consider the performance of the whole system when you are designing an application.
     * 
     * An application can use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtuallock">VirtualLock</a> function to lock ranges of the application's virtual address space in memory; however, that can potentially degrade the performance of the system.
     * @param {Pointer<HANDLE>} hProcess A handle to the process whose working set sizes is to be set.
     * 
     * The handle must have <b>PROCESS_SET_QUOTA</b> access rights. For more information, see 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ProcThread/process-security-and-access-rights">Process Security and Access Rights</a>.
     * @param {Pointer} dwMinimumWorkingSetSize The minimum working set size for the process, in bytes. The virtual memory manager attempts to keep at least this much memory resident in the process whenever the process is active.
     * 
     * This parameter must be greater than zero but less than or equal to the maximum working set size. The default size is 50 pages (for example, this is 204,800 bytes on systems with a 4K page size). If the value is greater than zero but less than 20 pages, the minimum value is set to 20 pages.
     * 
     * If both <i>dwMinimumWorkingSetSize</i> and <i>dwMaximumWorkingSetSize</i> have the value (<b>SIZE_T</b>)–1, the function removes as many pages as possible from the working set of the specified process.
     * @param {Pointer} dwMaximumWorkingSetSize The maximum working set size for the process, in bytes. The virtual memory manager attempts to keep no more than this much memory resident in the process whenever the process is active and available memory is low.
     * 
     * This parameter must be greater than or equal to 13 pages (for example, 53,248 on systems with a 4K page size), and less than the system-wide maximum (number of available pages minus 512 pages). The default size is 345 pages (for example, this is 1,413,120 bytes on systems with a 4K page size).
     * 
     * If both <i>dwMinimumWorkingSetSize</i> and <i>dwMaximumWorkingSetSize</i> have the value (<b>SIZE_T</b>)–1, the function removes as many pages as possible from the working set of the specified process. For details, see Remarks.

     * Locking pages into memory may degrade the performance of the system by reducing the available RAM and forcing the system to swap out other critical pages to the paging file.

     *      <i>flProtect</i> parameter specifies  <b>PAGE_READWRITE</b> or

     *      the new end of the file are not guaranteed to be zero; the behavior is defined by the file system.
     * 
     * If the file cannot be increased, the result is a failure to create the file mapping object and the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function returns 
     *      <b>ERROR_DISK_FULL</b>.
     * 
     * The handle that the <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> 
     *     function returns has full access to a new file mapping object and can be used with any function that requires a 
     *     handle to a file mapping object. A file mapping object can be shared through process creation, handle duplication, 
     *     or by name. For more information, see the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle">DuplicateHandle</a> and 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-openfilemappinga">OpenFileMapping</a> functions.
     * 
     * Creating a file mapping object creates the potential for mapping a view of the file but does not map the view. 
     *     The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-mapviewoffileexnuma">MapViewOfFileExNuma</a> function maps a view of a 
     *     file into a process address space.
     * 
     * With one important exception, file views derived from a single file mapping object are coherent or identical 
     *     at a specific time. If multiple processes have handles of the same file mapping object, they see a coherent view 
     *     of the data when they map a view of the file.
     * 
     * The exception is related to remote files. Although the 
     *     <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> function works with remote 
     *     files, it does not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable and both change 
     *     the same page, each computer sees only its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, the 
     *     page is not merged.
     * 
     * A mapped file and a file that is accessed by using the input and output (I/O) functions 
     *     (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> and 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a>) are not necessarily coherent.
     * 
     * To fully close a file mapping object, an application must unmap all mapped views of the file mapping object by 
     *      calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> function and then close 
     *      the file mapping object handle by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a> 
     *      function.
     * 
     * These functions can be called in any order. The call to the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> function is necessary, because mapped 
     *      views of a file mapping object maintain internal open handles to the object, and a file mapping object does not 
     *      close until all open handles to it are closed.
     * 
     * When modifying a file through a mapped view, the last modification timestamp may not be updated automatically. 
     *      If required, the caller should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime">SetFileTime</a> to set the 
     *      timestamp.
     * 
     * Creating a file-mapping object from a session other than session zero requires the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/authorization-constants">SeCreateGlobalPrivilege</a> privilege. 
     *      Note that this privilege check is limited to the creation of file mapping objects and does not apply to opening 
     *      existing ones. For example, if a service or the system creates a file mapping object, any process running in any 
     *      session can access that file mapping object provided that the caller has the required access rights.
     * 
     * Use structured exception handling to protect any code that writes to or reads from a memory mapped view. For 
     *      more information, see 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/reading-and-writing-from-a-file-view">Reading and Writing From a File View</a>.
     * 
     * To have a mapping with executable permissions, an application must call the 
     *      <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> function with either 
     *      <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</b> or <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</b> and then call the

    /**
     * Provides an efficient mechanism to bring into memory potentially discontiguous virtual address ranges in a process address space.
     * @remarks
     * The <b>PrefetchVirtualMemory</b> function is 
     *      targeted at applications that know with reasonable confidence the set of addresses they will be accessing. If 
     *      it's likely that these addresses are no longer resident in memory (i.e. they have been paged out to disk), 
     *      calling the <b>PrefetchVirtualMemory</b> function on 
     *      those address ranges before access will reduce the overall latency because the API will efficiently bring in 
     *      those address ranges from disk using large, concurrent I/O requests where possible.
     * 
     * The <b>PrefetchVirtualMemory</b> function allows 
     *      applications to make efficient use of disk hardware by issuing large, concurrent I/Os where possible when the 
     *      application provides a list of process address ranges that are going to be accessed. Even for a single address 
     *      range (e.g. a file mapping), the 
     *      <b>PrefetchVirtualMemory</b> function can provide 
     *      performance improvements by issuing a single large I/O rather than the many smaller I/Os that would be issued via 
     *      page faulting.
     * 
     * The <b>PrefetchVirtualMemory</b> function is purely 
     *      a performance optimization: prefetching is not necessary for accessing the target address ranges. The prefetched 
     *      memory is not added to the target process' working set; it is cached in physical memory. When the prefetched 
     *      address ranges are accessed by the target process, they will be added to the working set.
     * 
     * Since the <b>PrefetchVirtualMemory</b> function can 
     *      never be necessary for correct operation of applications, it is treated as a strong hint by the system and is 
     *      subject to usual physical memory constraints where it can completely or partially fail under low-memory 
     *      conditions. It can also create memory pressure if called with large address ranges, so applications should only 
     *      prefetch address ranges they will actually use.
     * 
     * To compile an application that calls this function, define <b>_WIN32_WINNT</b> as 
     *     <b>_WIN32_WINNT_WIN8</b> or higher. For more information, see 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/using-the-windows-headers">Using the Windows Headers</a>.

     *       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getcurrentprocess">GetCurrentProcess</a> function to use the current 
     *       process.

     * After a file mapping object is created, the size of the file must not exceed the size of the file mapping

     *     of the file between the old end of the file and the new end of the file are not guaranteed to be zero; the 
     *     behavior is defined by the file system. If the file on disk cannot be increased,

     * 
     * The initial contents of the pages in a file mapping object backed by the operating system paging file are 0 
     *     (zero).
     * 
     * The handle that <b>CreateFileMappingFromApp</b> 
     *     returns has full access to a new file mapping object, and can be used with any function that requires a handle to 
     *     a file mapping object.
     * 
     * Multiple processes can share a view of the same file   by either using a single shared file mapping object or 
     *     creating separate file mapping objects backed by the same file. A single file mapping object can be shared by 
     *     multiple processes through inheriting the handle at process creation, duplicating the handle, or opening the file 
     *     mapping object by name. For more information, see the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa">CreateProcess</a>, 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle">DuplicateHandle</a> and

     * 
     * Creating a file mapping object does not actually map the view into a process address space. The 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-mapviewoffileex">MapViewOfFileEx</a> function map a view of a file into a 
     *     process address space.
     * 
     * With one important exception, file views derived from any file mapping object that is backed by the same file 
     *     are coherent or identical at a specific time. Coherency is guaranteed for views within a process and for views 
     *     that are mapped by different processes.
     * 
     * The exception is related to remote files. Although 
     *     <b>CreateFileMappingFromApp</b> works with remote 
     *     files, it does not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable, and both change 
     *     the same page, each computer only sees its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, it is 
     *     not merged.
     * 
     * A mapped file and a file that is accessed by using the input and output (I/O) functions 
     *     (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> and 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a>) are not necessarily coherent.
     * 
     * Mapped views of a file mapping object maintain internal references to the object, and a file mapping object 
     *     does not close until all references to it are released. Therefore, to fully close a file mapping object, an 
     *     application must unmap all mapped views of the file mapping object by calling 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> and  close the file mapping object 
     *     handle by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a>. These functions can be 
     *     called in any order.
     * 
     * When modifying a file through a mapped view, the last modification timestamp may not be updated automatically. 
     *     If required, the caller should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime">SetFileTime</a> to set the

     * 
     * The file must be opened with access rights that are compatible with the protection flags that the

     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FileIO/file-security-and-access-rights">File Security and Access Rights</a>.
     * 
     * If <i>hFile</i> is <b>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</b>, the calling process 
     *        must also specify a size for the file mapping object in the <i>dwMaximumSizeHigh</i> and 
     *        <i>dwMaximumSizeLow</i> parameters. In this scenario, 
     *        <b>CreateFileMappingFromApp</b> creates a file

     * <li>Reserve a region of free pages</li>
     * <li>Simultaneously reserve and commit a region of free pages</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * 
     * <b>VirtualAllocExNuma</b> cannot reserve a reserved 
     *      page. It can commit a page that is already committed. This means you can commit a range of pages, regardless of 
     *      whether they have already been committed, and the function will not fail.
     * 
     * You can use <b>VirtualAllocExNuma</b> to reserve a 
     *      block of pages and then make additional calls to 
     *      <b>VirtualAllocExNuma</b> to commit individual pages from 
     *      the reserved block. This enables a process to reserve a range of its virtual address space without consuming 
     *      physical storage until it is needed.
     * 
     * If the <i>lpAddress</i> parameter is not <b>NULL</b>, the function uses 
     *      the <i>lpAddress</i> and <i>dwSize</i> parameters to compute the region of 
     *      pages to be allocated. The current state of the entire range of pages must be compatible with the type of 
     *      allocation specified by the <i>flAllocationType</i> parameter. Otherwise, the function fails 
     *      and none of the pages is allocated. This compatibility requirement does not preclude committing an already 
     *      committed page; see the preceding list.
     * 
     * Because <b>VirtualAllocExNuma</b> does not allocate any 
     *      physical pages, it will succeed whether or not the pages are available on that node or elsewhere in the system. 
     *      The physical pages are allocated on demand. If the preferred node runs out of pages, the memory manager will use 
     *      pages from other nodes. If the memory is paged out, the same process is used when it is brought back in.
     * 
     * To execute dynamically generated code, use 
     *      <b>VirtualAllocExNuma</b> to allocate memory and the

     *      <b>MEM_PHYSICAL</b> and <b>MEM_RESERVE</b> values must be set in the 
     *      <i>AllocationType</i> parameter. The <b>MEM_COMMIT</b> value must not be

     * 
     * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfreeex">VirtualFreeEx</a> function can decommit a committed 
     *      page, releasing the page's storage, or it can simultaneously decommit and release a committed page. It can also 
     *      release a reserved page, making it a free page.
     * 
     * To compile an application that uses this function, define <b>_WIN32_WINNT</b> as 0x0600 
     *      or later.

     * 
     * If you are committing memory that is already reserved, the function rounds this address down to the nearest

     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a> function.
     * 
     * If <i>lpAddress</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function determines where to

     * @param {Pointer} dwSize The size of the region of memory to be allocated, in bytes.
     * 
     * If <i>lpAddress</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function rounds 
     *        <i>dwSize</i> up to the next page boundary.

     * 
     * Each page has an associated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/page-state">page state</a>. The 
     *     <b>VirtualAllocFromApp</b> function can perform the following 
     *     operations:
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li>Commit a region of reserved pages</li>
     * <li>Reserve a region of free pages</li>
     * <li>Simultaneously reserve and commit a region of free pages</li>
     * </ul>
     * <b>VirtualAllocFromApp</b> cannot reserve a reserved page. It can 
     *     commit a page that is already committed. This means you can commit a range of pages, regardless of whether they 
     *     have already been committed, and the function will not fail.
     * 
     * You can use <b>VirtualAllocFromApp</b> to reserve a block of pages 
     *     and then make additional calls to <b>VirtualAllocFromApp</b> to commit 
     *     individual pages from the reserved block. This enables a process to reserve a range of its virtual address space 
     *     without consuming physical storage until it is needed.
     * 
     * If the <i>BaseAddress</i> parameter is not <b>NULL</b>, the function uses 
     *     the <i>BaseAddress</i> and <i>Size</i> parameters to compute the region of 
     *     pages to be allocated. The current state of the entire range of pages must be compatible with the type of 
     *     allocation specified by the <i>AllocationType</i> parameter. Otherwise, the function fails 
     *     and none of the pages are allocated. This compatibility requirement does not preclude committing an already 
     *     committed page, as mentioned previously.
     * 
     * <b>VirtualAllocFromApp</b> does not allow the creation of executable pages.
     * 
     * The <b>VirtualAllocFromApp</b> function can be used to reserve an 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/address-windowing-extensions">Address Windowing Extensions</a> (AWE) 
     *     region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. This region of memory can then be used 
     *     to map physical pages into and out of virtual memory as required by the application. The 
     *     <b>MEM_PHYSICAL</b> and <b>MEM_RESERVE</b> values must be set in the 
     *     <i>AllocationType</i> parameter. The <b>MEM_COMMIT</b> value must not be 
     *     set. The page protection must be set to <b>PAGE_READWRITE</b>.
     * 
     * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree">VirtualFree</a> function can decommit a committed 
     *     page, releasing the page's storage, or it can simultaneously decommit and release a committed page. It can also 
     *     release a reserved page, making it a free page.
     * 
     * When creating a region that will be executable, the calling program bears responsibility for ensuring cache 
     *     coherency via an appropriate call to 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache">FlushInstructionCache</a> once the code has been set 
     *     in place. Otherwise attempts to execute code out of the newly executable region may produce unpredictable 
     *     results.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} BaseAddress The starting address of the region to allocate. If the memory is being reserved, the specified address is 
     *       rounded down to the nearest multiple of the allocation granularity. If the memory is already reserved and is 
     *       being committed, the address is rounded down to the next page boundary. To determine the size of a page and the 
     *       allocation granularity on the host computer, use the 
     *       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a> function. If this parameter is 
     *       <b>NULL</b>, the system determines where to allocate the region.
     * @param {Pointer} Size The size of the region, in bytes. If the <i>BaseAddress</i> parameter is 
     *       <b>NULL</b>, this value is rounded up to the next page boundary. Otherwise, the allocated 
     *       pages include all pages containing one or more bytes in the range from <i>BaseAddress</i> to 
     *       <i>BaseAddress</i>+<i>Size</i>. This means that a 2-byte range straddling 
     *       a page boundary causes both pages to be included in the allocated region.
     * @param {Integer} AllocationType 
     * @param {Integer} Protection The memory protection for the region of pages to be allocated. If the pages are being committed, you can 
     *       specify one of the

     * Reserves, commits, or changes the state of a region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. The function initializes the memory it allocates to zero. (VirtualAlloc2)
     * @remarks
     * This function lets you specify:
     * 
     * - a range of virtual address space and a power-of-2 alignment restriction for new allocations
     * - an arbitrary number of extended parameters
     * - a preferred NUMA node for the physical memory as an extended parameter (see the <i>ExtendedParameters</i> parameter)
     * - a placeholder operation (specifically, replacement).
     * 
     * This API provides specialized techniques for managing virtual memory in support of high-performance games and server applications. For example, placeholders allow a reserved memory range to be explicitly partitioned, overlaid, and re-mapped; this can be used to implement arbitrarily extendable regions or virtual memory ring buffers. <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> also allows for allocating memory with a specific memory-alignment.
     * 
     * 
     * Each page has an associated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/page-state">page state</a>. The 
     *      <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> function can perform the following 
     *      operations:
     * 
     * <ul>
     * <li>Commit a region of reserved pages</li>
     * <li>Reserve a region of free pages</li>
     * <li>Simultaneously reserve and commit a region of free pages</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> can commit pages that are already committed, but cannot reserve pages that are already reserved.
     *     This means you can commit a range of pages, regardless of whether they have already been committed, and the function will not 
     *     fail. In general however, only a minimal range of mostly uncommitted pages should be specified, because committing 
     *     a large number of pages that are already committed can cause the <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> call to take much longer.
     * 
     * You can use <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> to reserve a block of pages and then make additional calls to <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> to 
     *     commit individual pages from the reserved block. This enables a process to reserve a range of its virtual address 
     *     space without consuming physical storage until it is needed.
     * 
     * If the <i>lpAddress</i> parameter is not <b>NULL</b>, the function uses 
     *     the <i>lpAddress</i> and <i>dwSize</i> parameters to compute the region of 
     *     pages to be allocated. The current state of the entire range of pages must be compatible with the type of 
     *     allocation specified by the <i>flAllocationType</i> parameter. Otherwise, the function fails 
     *     and none of the pages is allocated. This compatibility requirement does not preclude committing an already 
     *     committed page; see the preceding list.
     * 
     * To execute dynamically generated code, use 
     *     <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> to allocate memory, and the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotectex">VirtualProtectEx</a> function to grant 
     *     <b>PAGE_EXECUTE</b> access.
     * 
     * The <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> function can be used to reserve 
     *     an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/address-windowing-extensions">Address Windowing Extensions</a> 
     *     (AWE) region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. This region of memory can then be 
     *     used to map physical pages into and out of virtual memory as required by the application. The 
     *     <b>MEM_PHYSICAL</b> and <b>MEM_RESERVE</b> values must be set in the 
     *     <i>AllocationType</i> parameter. The <b>MEM_COMMIT</b> value must not be 
     *     set. The page protection must be set to <b>PAGE_READWRITE</b>.
     * 
     * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfreeex">VirtualFreeEx</a> function can decommit a committed 
     *     page, releasing the page's storage, or it can simultaneously decommit and release a committed page. It can also 
     *     release a reserved page, making it a free page.
     * 
     * When creating a region that will be executable, the calling program bears responsibility for ensuring cache 
     *     coherency via an appropriate call to 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache">FlushInstructionCache</a> once the code has been set 
     *     in place. Otherwise attempts to execute code out of the newly executable region may produce unpredictable 
     *     results.
     * @param {Pointer<HANDLE>} Process The handle to a process. The function allocates memory within the virtual address space of this process.
     * 
     * The handle must have the <b>PROCESS_VM_OPERATION</b> access right. For more information, 
     *        see 
     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ProcThread/process-security-and-access-rights">Process Security and Access Rights</a>.
     * 
     * If <i>Process</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function allocates memory for the calling process.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} BaseAddress The pointer that specifies a desired starting address for the region of pages that you want to allocate.
     * 
     *  If an explicit base address is specified, then it must be a multiple of the system allocation granularity. To determine the size of a page and the allocation granularity on the host computer, use the 
     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a> function.
     * 
     * If <i>BaseAddress</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function determines where to 
     *        allocate the region.
     * 
     * If this address is within an enclave that you have not initialized by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/enclaveapi/nf-enclaveapi-initializeenclave">InitializeEnclave</a>, <b>VirtualAlloc2</b> allocates a page of zeros for the enclave at that address. The page must be previously uncommitted, and will not be measured with the EEXTEND instruction of the Intel Software Guard Extensions programming model.
     * 
     * If the address in within an enclave that you initialized, then the allocation operation fails with the **ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS** error. That is true for enclaves that do not support dynamic memory management (i.e. SGX1). SGX2 enclaves will permit allocation, and the page must be accepted by the enclave after it has been allocated.
     * @param {Pointer} Size The size of the region of memory to allocate, in bytes.
     * 
     * The size must always be a multiple of the page size.
     * 
     * If <i>BaseAddress</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, the function allocates all 
     *        pages that contain one or more bytes in the range from <i>BaseAddress</i> to 
     *        <i>BaseAddress</i>+<i>Size</i>. This means, for example, that a 2-byte 
     *        range that straddles a page boundary causes the function to allocate both pages.
     * @param {Integer} AllocationType 
     * @param {Integer} PageProtection The memory protection for the region of pages to be allocated. If the pages are being committed, you can specify any one of the [memory protection constants](/windows/win32/Memory/memory-protection-constants).
     * @param {Pointer<MEM_EXTENDED_PARAMETER>} ExtendedParameters An optional pointer to one or more extended parameters of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-mem_extended_parameter">MEM_EXTENDED_PARAMETER</a>.

     *     the <i>BaseAddress</i> and <i>Size</i> parameters to compute the region of 
     *     pages to be allocated. The current state of the entire range of pages must be compatible with the type of 
     *     allocation specified by the <i>AllocationType</i> parameter. Otherwise, the function fails 
     *     and none of the pages are allocated. This compatibility requirement does not preclude committing an already 
     *     committed page, as mentioned previously.
     * 
     * <b>Virtual2AllocFromApp</b> does not allow the creation of executable pages.
     * 
     * The <b>Virtual2AllocFromApp</b> function can be used to reserve an 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/address-windowing-extensions">Address Windowing Extensions</a> (AWE) 
     *     region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. This region of memory can then be used 
     *     to map physical pages into and out of virtual memory as required by the application. The 
     *     <b>MEM_PHYSICAL</b> and <b>MEM_RESERVE</b> values must be set in the 
     *     <i>AllocationType</i> parameter. The <b>MEM_COMMIT</b> value must not be 
     *     set. The page protection must be set to <b>PAGE_READWRITE</b>.
     * 
     * The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree">VirtualFree</a> function can decommit a committed 
     *     page, releasing the page's storage, or it can simultaneously decommit and release a committed page. It can also 
     *     release a reserved page, making it a free page.
     * 
     * When creating a region that will be executable, the calling program bears responsibility for ensuring cache 
     *     coherency via an appropriate call to 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushinstructioncache">FlushInstructionCache</a> once the code has been set 
     *     in place. Otherwise attempts to execute code out of the newly executable region may produce unpredictable 
     *     results.
     * @param {Pointer<HANDLE>} Process The handle to a process. The function allocates memory within the virtual address space of this process.
     * 
     * The handle must have the <b>PROCESS_VM_OPERATION</b> access right. For more information, 
     *        see 
     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/ProcThread/process-security-and-access-rights">Process Security and Access Rights</a>.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} BaseAddress The pointer that specifies a desired starting address for the region of pages that you want to allocate.
     * 
     *  If an explicit base address is specified, then it must be a multiple of the system allocation granularity. To determine the size of a page and the allocation granularity on the host computer, use the 
     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a> function.
     * 
     * If <i>BaseAddress</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the function determines where to 
     *        allocate the region.
     * @param {Pointer} Size The size of the region of memory to allocate, in bytes.
     * 
     * The size must always be a multiple of the page size.
     * 
     * If <i>BaseAddress</i> is not <b>NULL</b>, the function allocates all 
     *        pages that contain one or more bytes in the range from <i>BaseAddress</i> to 
     *        <i>BaseAddress</i>+<i>Size</i>. This means, for example, that a 2-byte 
     *        range that straddles a page boundary causes the function to allocate both pages.
     * @param {Integer} AllocationType

     * Maps a view of a file mapping into the address space of a calling Windows Store app. (MapViewOfFile3FromApp)
     * @remarks
     * This API helps support high-performance games, and server applications, which have particular requirements around managing their virtual address space. For example, mapping memory on top of a previously reserved region; this is useful for implementing an automatically wrapping ring buffer. And allocating memory with specific alignment; for example, to enable your application to commit large/huge page-mapped regions on demand.
     * 
     * 
     * With one important exception, file views derived from any file mapping object that is backed by the same file 
     *     are coherent or identical at a specific time. Coherency is guaranteed for views within a process and for views 
     *     that are mapped by different processes.
     * 
     * The exception is related to remote files. Although 
     *     <b>MapViewOfFile3FromApp</b> works with remote files, it 
     *     does not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable, and both change the same 
     *     page, each computer only sees its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, it is not 
     *     merged.
     * 
     *  You can only successfully request executable protection if your app has the <b>codeGeneration</b> capability.
     * @param {Pointer<HANDLE>} FileMapping A <b>HANDLE</b> to a section that is to be mapped
     *                         into the address space of the specified process.
     * @param {Pointer<HANDLE>} Process A <b>HANDLE</b> to a process into which the section
     *                     will be mapped.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} BaseAddress The desired base address of the view.
     *                   The address is rounded down to the nearest 64k boundary.
     *                   If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, the system picks the base
     *                   address.
     * @param {Integer} Offset The offset from the beginning of the section.
     *              This must be 64k aligned.
     * @param {Pointer} ViewSize The number of bytes to map. A value of zero (0)
     *                specifies that the entire section is to be mapped.
     * 
     * The size must always be a multiple of the page size.

     * @param {Integer} PageProtection The desired page protection.
     * 
     * For file-mapping objects created with the <b>SEC_IMAGE</b> attribute, the

     * 
     * The movable-memory flags <b>GHND</b> and <b>GMEM_MOVABLE</b> add unnecessary overhead and require locking to be used safely. They should be avoided unless documentation specifically states that they should be used.

     * New applications should use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/heap-functions">heap functions</a> to allocate and manage memory unless the documentation specifically states that a global function should be used. For example, the global functions are still used with Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), the clipboard functions, and OLE data objects. 
     * 
     * If the <b>GlobalAlloc</b> function succeeds, it allocates at least the amount of memory requested. If the actual amount allocated is greater than the amount requested, the process can use the entire amount. To determine the actual number of bytes allocated, use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-globalsize">GlobalSize</a> function.
     * 
     * If the heap does not contain sufficient free space to satisfy the request, 
     * <b>GlobalAlloc</b> returns <b>NULL</b>. Because <b>NULL</b> is used to indicate an error, virtual address zero is never allocated. It is, therefore, easy to detect the use of a <b>NULL</b> pointer.
     * 
     * Memory allocated with this function is guaranteed to be aligned on an 8-byte boundary. To execute dynamically generated code, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc">VirtualAlloc</a> function to allocate memory and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect">VirtualProtect</a> function to grant  <b>PAGE_EXECUTE</b> access.
     * 
     * To free the memory, use the

     * Windows memory management does not provide a separate local heap and global heap. Therefore, the <b>LocalAlloc</b> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-globalalloc">GlobalAlloc</a> functions are essentially the same. 
     * 
     * The movable-memory flags <b>LHND</b>, <b>LMEM_MOVABLE</b>, and <b>NONZEROLHND</b> add unnecessary overhead and require locking to be used safely. They should be avoided unless documentation specifically states that they should be used.
     * 
     * New applications should use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/heap-functions">heap functions</a> unless the documentation specifically states that a local function should be used. For example, some Windows functions allocate memory that must be freed with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-localfree">LocalFree</a>.
     * 
     * If the heap does not contain sufficient free space to satisfy the request, 
     * <b>LocalAlloc</b> returns <b>NULL</b>. Because <b>NULL</b> is used to indicate an error, virtual address zero is never allocated. It is, therefore, easy to detect the use of a <b>NULL</b> pointer.
     * 
     * If the <b>LocalAlloc</b> function succeeds, it allocates at least the amount requested. If the amount allocated is greater than the amount requested, the process can use the entire amount. To determine the actual number of bytes allocated, use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-localsize">LocalSize</a> function.
     * 
     * To free the memory, use the 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-localfree">LocalFree</a> function. It is not safe to free memory allocated with <b>LocalAlloc</b> using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-globalfree">GlobalFree</a>.

     *     multiple processes through inheriting the handle at process creation, duplicating the handle, or opening the file 
     *     mapping object by name. For more information, see the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa">CreateProcess</a>,

     * 
     * With one important exception, file views derived from any file mapping object that is backed by the same file 
     *     are coherent or identical at a specific time. Coherency is guaranteed for views within a process and for views 
     *     that are mapped by different processes.
     * 
     * The exception is related to remote files. Although 
     *     <b>CreateFileMapping</b> works with remote files, it does 
     *     not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable, and both change the same page, 
     *     each computer only sees its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, it is not merged.
     * 
     * A mapped file and a file that is accessed by using the input and output (I/O) functions 
     *     (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> and 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a>) are not necessarily coherent.
     * 
     * Mapped views of a file mapping object maintain internal references to the object, and a file mapping object 
     *     does not close until all references to it are released. Therefore, to fully close a file mapping object, an 
     *     application must unmap all mapped views of the file mapping object by calling 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> and  close the file mapping object 
     *     handle by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a>. These functions can be 
     *     called in any order.
     * 
     * When modifying a file through a mapped view, the last modification timestamp may not be updated automatically. 
     *     If required, the caller should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime">SetFileTime</a> to set the 
     *     timestamp.
     * 
     * Creating a file mapping object in the global namespace from a session other than session zero requires the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/authorization-constants">SeCreateGlobalPrivilege</a> privilege. 
     *      Note that this privilege check is limited to the creation of file mapping objects and does not apply to opening 
     *      existing ones. For example, if a service or the system creates a file mapping object in the global namespace, any 
     *      process running in any session can access that file mapping object provided that the caller has the required 
     *      access rights.

     * After a file mapping object is created, the size of the file must not exceed the size of the file mapping 
     *     object; if it does, not all of the file contents are available for sharing.
     * 
     * The file mapping object can be shared by duplication, inheritance, or by name. The initial contents of the

     * 
     * If an application specifies a size for the file mapping object that is larger than the size of the actual 
     *      named file on disk and if the page protection allows write access (that is, the 
     *      <i>flProtect</i> parameter specifies  <b>PAGE_READWRITE</b> or 
     *      <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</b>), then the file on disk is increased to match the specified size 
     *      of the file mapping object. If the file is extended, the contents of the file between the old end of the file and 
     *      the new end of the file are not guaranteed to be zero; the behavior is defined by the file system.
     * 
     * If the file cannot be increased, the result is a failure to create the file mapping object and the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror">GetLastError</a> function returns 
     *      <b>ERROR_DISK_FULL</b>.
     * 
     * The handle that the <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> 
     *     function returns has full access to a new file mapping object and can be used with any function that requires a 
     *     handle to a file mapping object. A file mapping object can be shared through process creation, handle duplication, 
     *     or by name. For more information, see the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle">DuplicateHandle</a> and 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-openfilemappinga">OpenFileMapping</a> functions.
     * 
     * Creating a file mapping object creates the potential for mapping a view of the file but does not map the view. 
     *     The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-mapviewoffileexnuma">MapViewOfFileExNuma</a> function maps a view of a 
     *     file into a process address space.
     * 
     * With one important exception, file views derived from a single file mapping object are coherent or identical 
     *     at a specific time. If multiple processes have handles of the same file mapping object, they see a coherent view 
     *     of the data when they map a view of the file.
     * 
     * The exception is related to remote files. Although the 
     *     <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> function works with remote 
     *     files, it does not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable and both change 
     *     the same page, each computer sees only its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, the 
     *     page is not merged.
     * 
     * A mapped file and a file that is accessed by using the input and output (I/O) functions 
     *     (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> and 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a>) are not necessarily coherent.
     * 
     * To fully close a file mapping object, an application must unmap all mapped views of the file mapping object by 
     *      calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> function and then close 
     *      the file mapping object handle by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle">CloseHandle</a> 
     *      function.
     * 
     * These functions can be called in any order. The call to the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile">UnmapViewOfFile</a> function is necessary, because mapped 
     *      views of a file mapping object maintain internal open handles to the object, and a file mapping object does not 
     *      close until all open handles to it are closed.
     * 
     * When modifying a file through a mapped view, the last modification timestamp may not be updated automatically. 
     *      If required, the caller should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime">SetFileTime</a> to set the 
     *      timestamp.
     * 
     * Creating a file-mapping object from a session other than session zero requires the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/authorization-constants">SeCreateGlobalPrivilege</a> privilege. 
     *      Note that this privilege check is limited to the creation of file mapping objects and does not apply to opening 
     *      existing ones. For example, if a service or the system creates a file mapping object, any process running in any 
     *      session can access that file mapping object provided that the caller has the required access rights.
     * 
     * Use structured exception handling to protect any code that writes to or reads from a memory mapped view. For 
     *      more information, see 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/reading-and-writing-from-a-file-view">Reading and Writing From a File View</a>.
     * 
     * To have a mapping with executable permissions, an application must call the 
     *      <b>CreateFileMappingNuma</b> function with either 
     *      <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</b> or <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</b> and then call the 
     *      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-mapviewoffileexnuma">MapViewOfFileExNuma</a> function with

    /**
     * Maps a view of a file mapping into the address space of a calling process and specifies the NUMA node for the physical memory.
     * @remarks
     * Mapping a file makes the specified portion of the file visible in the address space of the calling 
     *     process.
     * 
     * For files that are larger than the address space, you can map only a small portion of the file data at one 
     *     time. When the first view is complete, then you unmap it and map a new view.
     * 
     * To obtain the size of a view, use the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualqueryex">VirtualQueryEx</a> function.
     * 
     * The initial contents of the pages in a file mapping object backed by the page file are 0 (zero).
     * 
     * If a suggested mapping address is supplied, the file is mapped at the specified address (rounded down to the 
     *     nearest 64-KB boundary) if there is enough address space at the specified address. If there is not enough address 
     *     space, the function fails.
     * 
     * Typically, the suggested address is used to specify that a file should be mapped at the same address in 
     *     multiple processes. This requires the region of address space to be available in all involved processes. No other 
     *     memory allocation can take place in the region that is used for mapping, including the use of the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocexnuma">VirtualAllocExNuma</a> function to reserve memory.
     * 
     * If the <i>lpBaseAddress</i> parameter specifies a base offset, the function succeeds if the 
     *      specified memory region is not already in use by the calling process. The system does not ensure that the same 
     *      memory region is available for the memory mapped file in other 32-bit processes.
     * 
     * Multiple views of a file (or a file mapping object and its mapped file) are <i>coherent</i> 
     *     if they contain identical data at a specified time. This occurs if the file views are derived from the same file 
     *     mapping object. A process can duplicate a file mapping object handle into another process by using the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle">DuplicateHandle</a> function, or another process can open 
     *     a file mapping object by name by using the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-openfilemappinga">OpenFileMapping</a> function.
     * 
     * With one important exception, file views derived from any file mapping object that is backed by the same file 
     *     are coherent or identical at a specific time. Coherency is guaranteed for views within a process and for views 
     *     that are mapped by different processes.
     * 
     * The exception is related to remote files. Although 
     *     <b>MapViewOfFileExNuma</b> works with remote files, it 
     *     does not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable, and both change the same 
     *     page, each computer only sees its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, it is not 
     *     merged.
     * 
     * A mapped view of a file is not guaranteed to be coherent with a file being accessed by the 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a> or 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a> function.
     * 
     * To guard against <b>EXCEPTION_IN_PAGE_ERROR</b> exceptions, use structured exception 
     *     handling to protect any code that writes to or reads from a memory mapped view of a file other than the page file. 
     *     For more information, see 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Memory/reading-and-writing-from-a-file-view">Reading and Writing From a File View</a>.
     * 
     * When modifying a file through a mapped view, the last modification timestamp may not be updated automatically. 
     *      If required, the caller should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-setfiletime">SetFileTime</a> to set the 
     *      timestamp.
     * 
     * To have a file with executable permissions, an application must call
     *     the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createfilemappingnumaa">CreateFileMappingNuma</a> function with either 
     *     <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</b> or <b>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</b>

     * @param {Integer} dwFileOffsetHigh The high-order <b>DWORD</b> of the file offset where the view is to begin.
     * @param {Integer} dwFileOffsetLow The low-order <b>DWORD</b> of the file offset where the view is to begin. The 
     *       combination of the high and low offsets must specify an offset within the file mapping. They must also match the 
     *       memory allocation granularity of the system. That is, the offset must be a multiple of the allocation

     *       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a> function, which fills in the members of

     * @param {Pointer} dwNumberOfBytesToMap The number of bytes of a file mapping to map to a view. All bytes must be within the maximum size specified 
     *       by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createfilemappinga">CreateFileMapping</a>. If this parameter is 0 
     *       (zero), the mapping extends from the specified offset to the end of the file mapping.
     * @param {Pointer<Void>} lpBaseAddress A pointer to the memory address in the calling process address space where mapping begins. This must be a 
     *        multiple of the system's memory allocation granularity, or the function fails. To determine the memory 
     *        allocation granularity of the system, use the 
     *        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsysteminfo">GetSystemInfo</a> function. If there is not enough

     * In a preemptive multitasking environment, it is possible for some other thread to change the process's access to the memory being tested. Even when the function indicates that the process has read access to the specified memory, you should use 
     * <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/structured-exception-handling">structured exception handling</a> when attempting to access the memory. Use of structured exception handling enables the system to notify the process if an access violation exception occurs, giving the process an opportunity to handle the exception.

     * > The winbase.h header defines IsBadStringPtr as an alias which automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant.

For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).
     * @param {Pointer<PWSTR>} lpsz A pointer to a null-terminated string, either Unicode or ASCII.
     * @param {Pointer} ucchMax The maximum size of the string, in <b>TCHARs</b>. The function checks for read access in all characters up to the string's terminating null character or up to the number of characters specified by this parameter, whichever is smaller. If this parameter is zero, the return value is zero.
     * @returns {Integer} If the calling process has read access to all characters up to the string's terminating null character or up to the number of characters specified by <i>ucchMax</i>, the return value is zero.
     * 
     * If the calling process does not have read access to all characters up to the string's terminating null character or up to the number of characters specified by <i>ucchMax</i>, the return value is nonzero.
     * 
     * If the application is compiled as a debugging version, and the process does not have read access to the entire memory range specified, the function causes an assertion and breaks into the debugger. Leaving the debugger, the function continues as usual, and returns a nonzero value This behavior is by design, as a debugging aid.

     * The physical pages may be unmapped, but they are not freed. You must call 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-freeuserphysicalpages">FreeUserPhysicalPages</a> to free the physical 
     *     pages.

     * You can specify any number of physical memory pages, but the memory cannot extend outside the virtual 
     *     address space that is allocated by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc">VirtualAlloc</a>. Any 
     *     existing address maps are automatically overwritten with the new translations, and the old translations are 
     *     unmapped.
     * 
     * You cannot map physical memory pages outside the range that is specified in 
     *     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-allocateuserphysicalpages">AllocateUserPhysicalPages</a>. You can map 
     *     multiple regions simultaneously, but they cannot overlap.
     * 
     * Physical pages can be located at any physical address, but do not make assumptions about the contiguity of the 
     *     physical pages.
     * 
     * In a multiprocessor environment, this function maintains hardware translation buffer coherence. On return 
     *     from this function, all threads on all processors are guaranteed to see the correct mapping.

     * 
     * The

     * @param {Pointer<UIntPtr>} PageArray A pointer to an array of values that indicates how each corresponding page in 
     *       <i>VirtualAddresses</i> should be treated. 
     * 
     * A 0 (zero) indicates that the corresponding entry in 
     *       <i>VirtualAddresses</i> should be unmapped, and any nonzero value that it has should be mapped.
     *       
     * 
     * If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, then every address in the <i>VirtualAddresses</i> array is
