/**
 * Describes the type of change to the rowset's data.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * This enumeration is used in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/searchapi/nf-searchapi-irowsetevents-onrowsetevent">IRowsetEvents::OnRowsetEvent</a> method to describe the type of event that affects a rowset.
  * 
  * The <b>ROWSETEVENT_TYPE_SCOPESTATISTICS</b> event gives you the same information available from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/searchapi/nf-searchapi-irowsetprioritization-getscopestatistics">IRowsetPrioritization::GetScopeStatistics</a> method call, but through a push mechanic, as follows: 
  * 
  * <ul>
  * <li>The event arises if the prioritization API has been used to request a non-default prioritization level, and a non-zero statistics event frequency.  </li>
  * <li>The event arises only when statistics actually change, and the interval specified in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/searchapi/nn-searchapi-irowsetprioritization">IRowsetPrioritization</a> has elapsed (the interval does not guarantee the frequency of the event).</li>
  * <li>This event is guaranteed to raise a "bounce zero" state (zero items remaining to be added, zero modifies remaining), provided that a non-zero event has been raised.</li>
  * <li>The indexer may process items without sending this event, if the queue empties before the statistics event frequency.</li>
  * </ul>
  * Check out the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/search/-search-sample-searchevents">SearchEvents code sample</a>.
