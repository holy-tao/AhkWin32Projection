/**
 * Provides a set of flags to be used with following methods to indicate the operation in ICondition::GetComparisonInfo, ICondition2::GetLeafConditionInfo, IConditionFactory::MakeLeaf, IConditionFactory2::CreateBooleanLeaf, IConditionFactory2::CreateIntegerLeaf, IConditionFactory2::MakeLeaf, IConditionFactory2::CreateStringLeaf, and IConditionGenerator::GenerateForLeaf.
 * @remarks
 * 
  * Because a resolved condition never has a <b>COP_IMPLICIT</b> operation, applications that evaluate condition trees should not encounter it. However, <b>COP_IMPLICIT</b> could be used in comparing the output of either <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/structuredquerycondition/nf-structuredquerycondition-icondition-getcomparisoninfo">ICondition::GetComparisonInfo</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/structuredquerycondition/nf-structuredquerycondition-icondition2-getleafconditioninfo">ICondition2::GetLeafConditionInfo</a> for a parsed unresolved condition to the output for a resolved condition.
  * 
  * In Windows 7, this enumeration is defined in structuredquerycondition.idl and structuredquerycondition.h. Prior to Windows 7 this enumeration was declared in structuredquery.h and structuredquery.idl.
