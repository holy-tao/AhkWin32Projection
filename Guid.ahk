/**
 * Represents a GUID struct. A GUID is a **G**lobally **U**nique **ID**entifier for some resource. 
 * It's "just" a 128-bit number under the hood. This is a funamental type in Windows and doesn't 
 * appear in the Win32 metadata, so it needs to be hand-written.
 * 
 * When working with AutoHotkey COM interop, it's generally enough to use a string repesentation.
 * However, some of the Win32 APIs (e.g. `Foundation\PROPERTYKEY`) expect a binary representation
 * or pointer to one, which this class exists to provide.
 * 
 * If you are going to be working a lot with GUIDs, you may want to [load](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/lib/_DllLoad.htm)
 * `ole32.dll` explicitly for performance reasons
 * 
 * @see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/guiddef/ns-guiddef-guid
