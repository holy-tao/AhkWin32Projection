# Contributing
Contributions are welcome to the examples or hand-written files at the root of the directory (`Win32Struct`, `CStyleArray`, etc). Make your changes in a development branch and submit a pull request. You can report bugs on the [issues tab](https://github.com/holy-tao/AhkWin32Projection/issues).

### Changes to generated code
Changes to generated code may require changes to the generator. Issues with the generated code must be written up against the [generator](https://github.com/holy-tao/AhkWin32Structs-Generator/issues) itself. 

If you want to add custom functionality to a generated type, you may be able to do so with an extension. Extensions are defined in the generator, see [extensions](https://github.com/holy-tao/AhkWin32Structs-Generator/tree/main/metadata/extensions) in the generator project. Extensions also require new testst to be written here
